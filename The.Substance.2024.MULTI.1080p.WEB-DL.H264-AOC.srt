1
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:57,820
-伊丽莎白 -看这里 -请看这里 -伊丽莎白 -我们爱你 -我们爱你

2
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:57,820
-Elizabeth -Over here -Look here please -Elizabeth -We love you -We love you

3
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,460
你能行！

4
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,460
You got it!

5
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,780
感受那股力量女士们

6
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,780
feel that power, ladies!

7
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,540
记住，膝盖要压下去，你可以的

8
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,540
And mark, get those knees down, you got it!

9
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,020
一起来

10
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,020
Come on!

11
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,020
踢臀！转身！

12
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,020
Butt! Hip!

13
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,160
没错，你做得很好

14
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,160
Oh yeah, you got it!

15
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,500
挺直，想象你穿着比基尼泡在海水里，你想

16
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,500
Square! Think about those bikini bathes you wanna...

17
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,980
看着像只沙滩上的水母一样

18
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,980
look like a giant jellyfish on the beach

19
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,500
继续

20
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,500
Come on!

21
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,120
伸展

22
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,120
Push!

23
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,780
你可以的，坚持住女士们，你们能行！

24
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,780
You got it! Hang in there ladies, you got it!

25
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,340
你可以的！

26
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,340
You got it!

27
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,360
锻炼完成，宝贝们！

28
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,360
Today's worked out baby!

29
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,720
好了我们下周见

30
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,720
All right then hope I'll see you next week

31
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,340
下次的《点亮你人生》我们将锻炼小腹部分

32
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,340
for Sparkle You Life, we 're gonna work on the latter labs

33
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,800
也是最难塑肌的部位

34
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,800
you know, the most difficult part to sculpts

35
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,980
与此同时，照顾好自己

36
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,980
but at the mean time, take care of yourselves

37
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,480
完事儿，一号位

38
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,480
work's fine, position one

39
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,740
干得漂亮！谢谢大家！

40
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,740
Great jobs,ladies!

41
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,080
大家辛苦了，很不错

42
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,080
-You got it! -Nice one

43
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,720
生日快乐

44
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,720
Happy birthday.

45
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,960
谢谢

46
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,960
thank you

47
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,800
生日快乐

48
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,800
Happy birthday.

49
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,880
哦，谢谢

50
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,880
Oh, thank you.

51
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,960
生日快乐

52
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,960
Happy birthday.

53
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
谢谢

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
Thank you.

55
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,660
我不管你们是否要把镇上的小姑娘全找一遍

56
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,660
I don't care if every fucking young girl in the fucking town

57
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,180
几周内给我完成

58
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,180
in these few weeks.

59
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,260
听着，我说的很简单了

60
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,260
Look, I made it simple.

61
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,280
找年轻的

62
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,280
We need her young.

63
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,580
身材辣的

64
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,580
We need her hot.

65
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,240
马上去给我找

66
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,240
We need her now.

67
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,400
怎么能让那黄脸婆主持这么久

68
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,400
How the old bitch has been able to stick around for this long.

69
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,980
我他妈就不明白了

70
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,980
That's the fucking mystery to me.

71
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,200
哦得了吧，得过奥斯卡也得擦屁股滚蛋

72
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,200
Oh, Oscar winner, my ass.

73
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,000
再说得奥斯卡那是多少年前了？

74
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,000
When was that back in the 30s?

75
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,020
怎么，就因为一部《金刚》？

76
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,020
What, for King Kong?

77
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,260
不，鬼才记得给过她承诺

78
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,260
No, I don't give a fuck what we promised her.

79
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,480
这是网络电视节目

80
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,480
This is network TV,

81
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,040
不是傻逼慈善项目

82
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,040
not a fucking charity.

83
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,320
赶紧给我找新人

84
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,320
Find me somebody new.

85
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,800
快！

86
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,800
Now.

87
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,660
嘿，你知道女人25岁后就开始衰败了吗？

88
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,660
Hey, did you know that a woman's
fertility starts to decrease by the age of 25?

89
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,420
珍妮弗都几岁了？

90
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,420
How old is Jennifer?

91
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,660
你最好赶快

92
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,660
You better get busy.

93
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,580
伊丽莎白

94
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,780
她那老脸在电视上就跟屏幕上沾了屎一样

95
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,780
It's like when you see someone fart on screen.

96
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,020
人们喜欢的是美女

97
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,020
People just love that.

98
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,860
懂吗？这种节目就得小年轻干

99
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,860
I mean, that's just the way it is.

100
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,440
你能听懂吧？

101
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,440
So you know what I mean?

102
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,040
人的本性不会变

103
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,040
People are just people.

104
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,100
我就得按照人的本性来做

105
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,100
And I have to give people what they want.

106
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,190
股东也喜欢这么做

107
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,190
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

108
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,780
而人们更是喜新厌旧

109
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,780
And people always ask for something new.

110
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,660
不得不换人

111
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,660
Renewal is inevitable.

112
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,180
等到了50岁

113
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,180
And at 50, well, 

114
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,580
就绝经了

115
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,580
it stops.

116
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,640
绝什么？

117
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,640
What stops?

118
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,160
嗯？

119
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,160
What?

120
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,980
你说绝什么？

121
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,980
What stops?

122
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,080
额，你知道，就是

123
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,080
Um, you know, the um...

124
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,440
额……

125
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,440
The um...

126
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,720
额……

127
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,720
The um...

128
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,220
哦，乔治！

129
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,220
Oh, George!

130
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,080
哦，哦！

131
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,080
Oh, oh!

132
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,540
-抱歉我得走了 -哈维！

133
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,540
-I'm sorry, I gotta run. -Harvey!

134
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,700
乔治！节目评价太赞了！

135
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,700
George! Those ratings are insane!

136
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,360
你真是天才

137
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,360
You're a genius!

138
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,280
哦，这有点乱

139
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,280
Oh, what a mess.

140
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,640
你太牛了

141
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,640
You're a genius.

142
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,200
所以才来庆祝

143
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,200
That's why you'd be drinking.

144
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,600
哦，太搞了

145
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,600
Oh, that's hilarious.

146
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,640
斯巴克女士，您走运了

147
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,640
Well, it's your lucky day, Miss Sparkle,

148
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,620
我们对您进行了全身扫描

149
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,620
because we have X-rayed you from head to toe,

150
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,800
您并没有任何牙隐裂

151
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,800
 and you don't have so much as a crap molar.

152
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,380
您可以离开了

153
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,380
So, you are good to go.

154
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,780
额，疫苗已接种，ok

155
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,780
Uh, vaccination, okay?

156
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,160
没有度假计划 

157
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,160
Not going on a vacation.

158
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,920
对了，我老婆，她是您的忠实粉丝

159
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,920
By the way, I just want to say, my wife is a huge fan.

160
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,980
额，血型……

161
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,980
Um, blood type...

162
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,090
哦，嘿，今天是您的生日

163
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,090
Oh, hey, it's your birthday.

164
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,900
生日快乐

165
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,900
Happy birthday.

166
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,290
哦，是紧急呼叫，抱歉，我得去额……

167
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,290
Oh, uh, that's an emergency, I'm sorry. I, uh, had to have a...

168
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,700
再见

169
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,700
Bye.

170
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,700
稍等

171
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,700
One moment.

172
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,800
最后一项检查有点……

173
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,800
It's just one last exam to perform.

174
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,080
你刚才不是说我没事了吗

175
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,080
I thought he said I was good to go.

176
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,660
有问题吗？

177
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,660
Is there a problem?

178
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,940
没有，一切都很好

179
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,940
No, it's perfect.

180
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,910
您是我们的绝佳人选

181
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,910
You're a good candidate.

182
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,170
我是说，您要离开了吗

183
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,170
I mean, are you good to go?

184
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,870
祝您好运

185
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,870
I wish you the best.

186
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,040
“它改变了我的人生”

187
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,460
莉兹？

188
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,460
Lizzie?

189
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,650
莉兹 斯巴克？

190
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,650
Lizzie Sparkle?

191
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,880
天啊，不敢相信

192
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,880
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

193
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,170
费雷德

194
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,170
Fred!

195
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,300
十年级大课同班的弗雷德

196
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,300
Fred, from 10th grade homeroom!

197
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,700
哦，弗雷德，我当然记得

198
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,700
Oh, Fred, of course.

199
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,540
你真是一点没变啊

200
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,540
You haven't changed a bit.

201
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,950
还是这么美丽动人

202
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,950
You're still the most beautiful girl in the whole wide world.

203
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,600
知道吗，我跟随你进了同个行业

204
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,600
You know, I followed your career.

205
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,520
你可太成功了

206
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,520
What a success.

207
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,440
我是说，哇，哇，哇

208
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,440
I mean, wow, wow, wow.

209
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,660
哇

210
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,660
Wow.

211
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,320
嘿，不如我们一起去

212
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,320
Hey, why don't we go out 

213
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,780
抽空喝几杯

214
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,780
maybe for a drink sometime

215
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,920
既然都，又遇见了，保持联系？

216
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,920
 now that we're, you know, reconnected?

217
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,840
额……

218
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,840
Um...

219
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,300
哦，对，我的错

220
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,300
Oh, of course, I'm stupid.

221
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
你肯定很忙

222
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
You're super busy.

223
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,060
不过

224
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,060
But you know what?

225
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,380
不如你把名片给我

226
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,380
Why don't you give me your card?

227
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,600
还是说你，你没带……

228
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,600
I mean, you never help.

229
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,160
额，行，多可惜

230
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,160
Um, sure, what I...ah

231
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,740
这个体检单给你也行

232
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,740
This will do. Oh.

233
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,070
别看我的胆固醇指数，简直是场灾难

234
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,070
Don't look at my cholesterol levels. They're a disaster.

235
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,820
哦天啊

236
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,820
Oh, God.

237
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,000
这是啥？

238
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,000
What is that?

239
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,840
给吧

240
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,840
There.

241
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,160
现在你有我联系方式了

242
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,160
Now you've got it.

243
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,720
“感谢多年相伴！怀念往昔，那时的你太赞了！”

244
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,380
你有没有梦想过

245
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,380
Have you ever dreamt 

246
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,710
成为华丽的自己

247
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,710
of a better version of yourself?

248
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,780
更年轻

249
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,780
Younger.

250
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,770
更美丽

251
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,770
More beautiful.

252
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,920
更完美

253
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,920
More perfect.

254
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,200
只需一次注射就能解放你的DNA

255
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,200
One single injection unlocks your DNA,

256
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,440
开始新的细胞分裂

257
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,440
starting a new cellular division

258
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,600
创造出另一个自己

259
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,600
that will release another version of yourself.

260
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,580
试试“某种物质”

261
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,580
This is the substance.

262
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,940
以你为基体

263
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,940
You are the matrix.

264
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
创造一切

265
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
Everything comes from you.

266
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,960
享有一切

267
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,960
And everything is you.

268
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,660
一个更华丽的自己

269
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,660
This is simply a better version of yourself.

270
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,450
只需相互分享

271
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,450
You just have to share.

272
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,160
一周是老的你

273
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,160
One week for one

274
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,640
一周是新的你

275
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,640
and one week for the other.

276
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,800
交替七天的完美平衡

277
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,800
A perfect balance of seven days each.

278
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,220
只需铭记

279
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,220
The one and only thing not to forget.

280
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,960
你们是一体的

281
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,960
You are one.

282
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,700
你无法躲避你自己

283
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,700
You can't escape from yourself.

284
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,560
喂？

285
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,560
Yes.

286
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,050

287

better version of yourself.

318
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,560
你好

319
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,560

我很渴望这个机会

327
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,430
I'm just dying to get the part.

很棒的舞者

Great dancer.

330
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,880
嗯，可惜不能像看她脸一样直接看她那对奶子

331
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,880
Hmm, too bad her boobs aren't in the middle of her instead of the nose.

332
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,800
下一位！

00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,260
I'm Sue.

342
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:12,400
苏，苏，苏，苏，苏，苏，苏，苏，苏，苏，苏

343
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:12,400
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.

344
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,800
苏，苏，苏，苏，苏

345
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,800
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.

346
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,780
她在哪？

347
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,780
Where is she?

348
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,800
她在哪？

349
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,800
Where is she?

350
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,100
多么美艳的天使

351
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,100
What a gorgeous little angel.

352
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,720
你被录取了

353
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,720
You're hired.

354
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,700
我们的节目就需要你这样的人

355
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,700
We want a show that's just like you.

356
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,320
美丽快乐，蠢蠢欲动

357
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,320
Beautiful and happy.

358
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,160
人们都想开心

359
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,160
People want to be happy.

360
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,000
我们两周后开播，开始准备吧

361
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,000
We air in two weeks, so let's get to work.

362
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,660
剩下的交给我的助理就行

363
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,660
I'm gonna let you organize the rest with my assistant. uh...

364
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,720
-她叫…… -伊莎贝拉

365
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,720
-uh... -Isabella?

366
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,760
以-依-伊莎

367
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,760
Is-is-isis.

368
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,360
破名字念着都费劲对吧？

369
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,360
Who has time to say that?

370
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,440
以后就叫你辛迪得了

371
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,440
We're gonna make you Cindy.

372
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,680
名字更短，也更方便

373
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,680
It's shorter, it's better.

374
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,920
就这样，以后辛迪会给你安排详细，去做准备吧

375
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,920
So, I'm gonna let you organize everything else with Cindy.

376
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,800
哦，对了，走之前

377
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,800
Oh, um, before you go,

378
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,720
我有一个小问题

379
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,720
I just have to mention a...

380
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,100
关于我的行程安排

381
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,100
small scheduling issue.

382
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,760
我必须每隔一周去城外一趟

383
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,760
I have to be out of town every other week

384
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,840
照顾我母亲

385
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,840
to take care of my mother

386
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,780
她病得很严重

387
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,780
mother, who's very sick.

388
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,220
我只想要你来做这个节目

389
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,220
I want you for this show

390
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,740
你妈也好你，兄弟也好

391
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,740
and we will work around any mother, brother,

392
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,120
甚至你的阿猫阿狗也好，不管他妈生了什么病我们都能照顾好

393
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,120
fucking sick, puppy you need to take care of.

394
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,960
懂吗？

395
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,960
Hmm?

396
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,320
懂吗？

397
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,320
Hmm.

398
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,340
人美，还心地善良

399
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,340
Gorgeous, with a pure heart.

400
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,000
观众肯定会喜欢

401
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,000
People are gonna love that.

402
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,320
很好

403
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,320
Perfect.

404
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
“新人
新秀
即将推出”

405
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,400
跳跃，环胸，

406
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,400
So you jump out, touch your elbows,

407
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,360
低下头，拉伸

408
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,360
head down, contract.

409
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,880
五六七八，环胸

410
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,880
And five, six, seven, eight, elbows.

411
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,480
你去哪了？

412
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,480
Where have you been?

413
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,620
我一直想找你喝一杯给你送行

414
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,620
I've all been wanting to have a drink with you for your departure.

415
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,580
总而言之

416
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,580
Anyway,

417
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,320
我们额，众筹了下

418
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,320
 we uh...all chipped in

419
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,940
给你准备了点小礼物供你消遣

420
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,940
and we got you just a little something to keep you busy.

421
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,060
这可是本法语书

422
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,060
It's French.

423
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,940
我老婆，她还为此生气了

424
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,940
My wife, she's for her spire.

425
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,740
哦，我可不想惹她

426
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,740
Oh, I don't want my wife.

427
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,220
糟了，我得走了

428
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,220
Oops, I gotta run.

429
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,460
很高兴要是还能再见到你

430
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,460
But it's always great to see you.

431
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,140
像羚羊和鹿角在你肌肤上移动

432
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,140
The antelope and the deer moving about

433
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,840
这可不是纸上谈兵

434
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,840
are going through the text.

435
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,330
这些按摩角还可远程操控.

436
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,330
The antelope with remotes.

437
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:51,360
竟然只卖49块9

438
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:51,360
I cannot believe the incredible price for $49.98.

439
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:38,620
混蛋，他们都要拿手机报警了，别弄噪音坏人事儿了！

440
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:38,620
God damn it, they have the phone and it's such a great night.

441
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,090
开门！

442
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,090
Open up.

443
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,000
快开门！

444
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,000
We gotta open up.

445
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,380
额，不好意思

446
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,380
And uh, sorry.

447
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,060
我以为是斯巴克那老太太

448
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,060
I thought that Ms. Sparkle.

449
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,260
她搬走了

450
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,260
She moved out.

451
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,780
我是新租客

452
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,780
I'm the new tenant.

453
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,090
苏

454
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,090
Sue.

455
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,040
奥夫

456
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,040
Olver.

457
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,380
奥利夫

458
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,380
Over.

459
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,400
奥利弗

460
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,400
Oliver.

461
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,200
你找我有事儿吗？

462
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,200
You wanted to complain about something?

463
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,680
奥利弗

464
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,680
Oliver?

465
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,550
怎么会？

466
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,550
What?

467
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,840
没事儿

468
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,840
No.

469
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,500
没没没没没没没

470
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

471
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,400
就是

472
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,400
I think it's

473
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:12,280
like awesome

474
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,280
感觉挺棒的

475
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,740
听着那些装修工具嗡嗡响，你能懂吗

476
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,740
when there's stuff going on in the building, you know what I mean?

477
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,680
额，事实上我还

478
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,680
Um, I'm actually,

479
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,780
我动手能力还挺强的，如果你需要帮忙

480
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,780
quite handy if you ever need,

481
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,080
或者需要各种援助、急救，额

482
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,080
need me to be of aid in any way. Ummm...

483
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,620
我一大袋子工具呢

484
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,620
I got a sack of tools and...

485
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,040
还有个大榔头

486
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,040
and a big hammer.

487
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,840
你懂我意思

488
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,840
You know what I mean.

489
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,560
总之，我也住这儿

490
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,560
Anyways, I live right here,

491
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,230
有需要就来找我

492
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,230
so you know where to find me.

493
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,440
Anytime.

494
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,440
随叫随到

495
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,400
不分昼夜

496
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,400
Day or night.

497
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,280
以后见

498
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,280

499
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,060
嗨各位

500
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,060
Hi everybody.

501
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,260
我是苏，是时候动起来啦

502
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,260
I'm Sue and it's time to pump it up.

503
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,560
准备好了吗？

504
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,560
Are you ready?

505
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,550
开始

506
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,550
Let's go.

507
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,720
感谢各位

508
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,720
Thank you so much everybody.

509
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,680
我们下周见

510
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,680
I'll see you next week.

511
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,980
与此同时

512
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,980
And in the meantime,

513
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,660
大家要保重哦

514
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,660
take care of yourself.

515
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,360
真有礼貌！

516
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,360
courtesy!

517
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,880
太绝了，太绝了

518
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,880
Wonderful, wonderful.

519
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,450
我不会待太晚，等我下

520
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,450
I won't be out late, so just wait for me.

521
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,680
别吃太快

522
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,680
Don't eat too fast.

523
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,380
你还好吗？

524
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,380
Are you all right?

525
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,020
没事，马上回来

526
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,020
Yes, I'll be right back.

527
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,640
你还好吗？

528
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,640
Are you all right?

529
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,660
你干什么去了？

530
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,660
What did you do?

531
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,300
你看着比之前还要美

532
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,300
You've seen me the more beautiful than before.

533
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,720
不

534
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,720
No.

535
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,310
“喝醉了不能骑摩托了，先留你这儿啦！:-）---特洛伊”

536
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,100
“和苏一起
动起来”

537
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:35,980
喂

538
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:35,980
Yes.

539
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,080
喂，你好

540
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,080
Yes, hi.

541
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,560
我是伊丽莎白 斯巴克

542
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,560
This is Elizabeth Sparkle.

543
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,280
503号

544
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,280
I'm 503.

545
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,820
请讲

546
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,820
Yes.

547
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,300
嗯你好

548
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,300
Yes, hi.

549
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,520
我用某种物质时没算好时间

550
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,520
There's been a slight misuse of the substance.

551
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:03,720
额外多用了一个小时

552
01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:03,720
A few extra hours were accidentally used

553
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:08,400
结果手指额……变异了

554
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:08,400
causing umm... an alteration.

555
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,980
我想知道该怎么把它恢复原样

556
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,980
So I'm just looking for the procedure to reverse it.

557
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,000
另一个你消耗的时间到你身上就没了

558
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,000
What has been used on one side is lost on the other side

559
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,940
没办法补救

560
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,940
There's no going back.

561
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:27,480
不，我不知道她是怎么想的

562
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:27,480
No, I don't know what she was thinking.

563
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,200
而且显然她是喝醉了

564
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,200
And obviously she was drunk.

565
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:32,620
铭记没有你和她之分

566
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:32,620
Remember there is no she and you.

567
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,160
你们是一体的

568
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,160
You are one.

569
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,770
遵循平衡

570
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,770
Respect the balance

571
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:38,210
就不会有任何差错

572
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:38,210
and you won't have any more inconveniences.

573
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:19,220
你难道不知道，不知道，不知道，不知道

574
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:19,220
Don't you know, know, know, know

575
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,740
你难道不知道

576
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,740
Don't you know

577
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,480
你得动起来

578
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,480
You got to pump it up

579
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,860
你难道不知道，不知道，不知道，不知道

580
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,860
Don't you know, know, know, know

581
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,960
你难道不知道

582
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:29,960
Don't you know

583
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,660
你得动起来，动起来，动起来，动起来

584
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,660
You got to pump it up, pump it up, pump it up, pump it up

585
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,540
动起来，动起来，动起来

586
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,540
pump it up, pump it up, pump it up

587
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,000
你得动起来

588
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,000
You got to pump it up

589
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:54,370
你得动起来

590
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:54,370
You got to pump it up

591
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,620
苏！

592
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,620
Sue!

593
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,640
苏！

594
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,640
Sue?

595
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,960
我在电视上看见你了

596
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,960
I just saw you on TV.

597
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,020
我勒个去

598
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,020
Holy moly.

599
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,600
看得我想报你的班了

600
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,600
Makes me want to join your class.

601
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:30,000
嘿，你不开私教课对吗？

602
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:30,000
Hey, you don't give private lessons, do you?

603
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,620
嘿，额……

604
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,620
Hey, ummm... 

605
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,600
要不要来我家里喝点酒？

606
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,600
What about a drink at my place tonight?

607
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,960
来啊，别害羞

608
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,960
Come on, don't be shy.

609
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:44,700
我知道你就站在门后，大美人

610
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:44,700
I see you standing behind the door there, gorgeous.

611
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,160
行吧

612
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,160
All right, 

613
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,180
慢慢来，但记得我约了你哦

614
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,180
take your time, but it's a date.

615
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,860
你懂的，动起来

616
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,860
You know, pump it up

617
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,900
你得动起来

618
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,900
You got to pump it up

619
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,940
你懂的，动起来

620
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,940
You know, pump it up

621
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,400
你得动起来

622
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,400
You got to pump it up

623
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,660
苏

624
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,660
Sue.

625
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,740
来点什么？

626
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,740
What can I get you?

627
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,780
摩卡拿铁

628
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,780
Moka Latte.

629
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,020
很难熬对吗？

630
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,020
It's long, isn't it?

631
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,640
你说什么？

632
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,640
Excuse me?

633
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,380
七天很难熬

634
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,380
Seven days.

635
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:22,500
你跟踪我来的吗？

636
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:22,500
Did you follow me here?

637
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,960
我就是好奇

638
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,960
I was just curious

639
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:28,200
好奇你发生了什么

640
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:28,200
to find out how things were going for you.

641
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,680
每一次你都感觉更加

642
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,680
Each time you feel a little more...

643
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,700
孤独

644
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,700
lonely, 

645
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,640
不是吗？

646
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,640
don't you think?

647
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,020
我不知道你在说什么

648
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,020
I don't know what you were talking about.

649
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,980
我很好

650
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,980
I'm fine.

651
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,760
万事大吉

652
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,760
Everything's fine.

653
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,280
每一次都会更加困难

654
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,280
It gets harder each time 

655
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:52,940
记住你还值得活在世上

656
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:52,940
to remember that you still deserve to exist.

657
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,560
再丑陋的你也是你

658
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,560
That this part of yourself

659
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,040
也有活着的意义

660
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,040
is still worth something

661
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:05,220
你还值得

662
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:05,220
that you still matter.

663
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,480
她已经开始了吗？

664
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,480
Has she started yet?

665
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,400
开始蚕食你了吗？

666
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,400
Eating away at you?

667
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,700
操！

668
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,700
Fuck!

669
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,880
小心点！

670
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,880
Watch out!

671
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:44,520
看什么？

672
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:44,520
What?

673
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:55,860
嘿！

674
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:55,860
Hey!

675
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,240
滚啊！

676
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:57,240
Move!

677
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:32,320
你还是那么美丽动人

678
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:32,320
You're still the most beautiful girl in the whole wild world.

679
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,260
你好？

680
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,260
Hello?

681
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,120
嗨，弗雷德

682
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,120
Hi, Fred.

683
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,540
我是莉兹

684
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,540
It's Lizzie.

685
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,550
喂？

686
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,550
Hello?

687
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,200
抱歉，我，我呆住了

688
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,200
Sorry, I mean, I'm a chalk.

689
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,380
哦

690
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,380
Oh.

691
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,130
哇

692
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,130
Wow.

693
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,510
哇，哇

694
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,510
Wow, wow.

695
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:58,160
我还以为永远都接不到你的电话了……

696
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:58,160
I thought I'd never hear from you again after-...

697
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:01,620
哦，天，别，不是，我只是，有点

698
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:01,620
Oh gosh, no, no, not at all. I just, I've just...

699
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,860
最近有点忙不开

700
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,860
I've just been really busy lately.

701
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,860
我想说，我在想

702
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,860
So listen, I was thinking that

703
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,920
我们有空可以一起聚一聚？

704
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,920
maybe we could get together and grab a drink?

705
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,700
你还在听吗？

706
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,700
Are you still there?

707
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,640
抱歉，我，我，我，我又惊呆了

708
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,640
Sorry, I'm, I'm, I'm in shock again.

709
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:28,340
那我定路易吉餐厅，八点行吗？

710
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:28,340
I could book Luigi's at eight?

711
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:31,380
八，八，那就八点路易吉餐厅见

712
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:31,380
Ei...Ei...Eight in Luigi's it is.

713
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:34,920
啊，我……我们晚上见

714
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:34,920
Uh I... I will see you tonight.

715
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:36,780
拜拜

716
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:36,780
Bye.

717
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,940
好的，拜

718
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,940
Okay, bye.

719
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:24,850
“弗雷德
我到餐厅了
你要迟到了吗
我知道你肯定想闪亮登场 :)
你还好吗？”

720
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,180
嗨，各位

721
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:44,180
Hi everybody.

722
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,140
嗨

723
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,140
Hi.

724
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,100
好了，我们开始，把台子清理一下

725
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,100
Okay, here we go everyone. Clear the set please.

726
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,770
第一机位，谢谢

727
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,770
First positions, thank you.

728
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,660
运镜开始

729
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,660
Roll cameras.

730
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:55,440
三，二，一

731
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:55,440
And in three, two, one.

732
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,860
下蹲，下蹲，下蹲

733
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,860
Squat, squat, squat.

734
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,540
屁股扭一圈

735
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,540
Circle those hips.

736
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,340
屁股扭一圈

737
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,340
Circle those hips.

738
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:11,480
拉伸，拉伸，拉伸，拉伸，拉伸，拉伸

739
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:11,480
Contract, contract, contract, contract, contract, contract.

740
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,280
抱头下腰

741
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,280
head between your legs.

742
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,040
停

743
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,040
Cut.

744
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,640
不好意思，我以为，我以为，我

745
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,640
I'm sorry, I thought I, thought I, I,

746
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,120
我走神了

747
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,120
I just got distracted.

748
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,700
没关系，再回退一遍

749
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,700
Not a problem, let's get right back to it.

750
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,320
从一机位开始

751
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,320
Back to one please.

752
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,900
打扰一下，管理室找

753
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,900
Sorry, it's the control room now.

754
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,400
导演说他从监控器看到奇怪的东西

755
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,400
The director said he saw something bizarre on the monitor.

756
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,020
摄像机重播一下，二号位

757
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,020
Bring up the replay on camera two.

758
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,140
二号机

759
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,140
Camera two.

760
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,300
快进

761
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,300
Forward.

762
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:04,980
我能换上礼服吗？

763
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:04,980
Can I have my dressing gown?

764
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:05,900
抱歉，礼服在更衣室

765
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:05,900
Sorry, it's in your dressing room.

766
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,370
那你快去拿去啊！

767
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,370
Well go and and get it.

768
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,780
慢慢播，一帧一帧

769
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,780
Let's just take this frame by frame.

770
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,740
给我五分钟

771
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,740
I need five minutes.

772
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:24,340
喂

773
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:24,340
Yes.

774
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,140
平衡没效了

775
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,140
This balance is not working.

776
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:28,650
我压根没时间享受

777
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:28,650
I barely have anytime to enjoy myself

778
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,500
而她却能虚度七天

779
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,500
while she wastes seven days

780
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,400
整日把脸埋电视机里

781
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,400
stuffing her face in front of the TV.

782
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,600
铭记没有你和她之分

783
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,600
Remember there is no she and you.

784
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:41,280
爱你们

785
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:41,280
I love everybody.

786
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,320
怎么了？

787
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,320
What's happening?

788
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,400
大家去哪了？

789
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,400
Where is everybody?

790
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,160
节目取消了

791
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,160
The TV's been canceled.

792
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:51,860
-什么？为什么？ -苏

793
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:51,860
-What, why? -Sue.

794
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,080
哈维要你马上去办公室见他

795
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,080
Harvey wants to see you in his office immediately.

796
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,460
知道了

797
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,460
Okay.

798
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,040
我会让他改变主意

799
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:58,040
I'll go change him.

800
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,880
不，他让你马上去

801
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,880
No, he said now.

802
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,780
我就开门见山了

803
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:18,780
I'll get right to the bond.

804
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,190
你不能一直做早间节目

805
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,190
We can't keep you on the morning show.

806
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,440
为什么？我才刚做起来

807
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,440
But why? I just started.

808
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,340
收视率登顶了

809
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:28,340
Ratings are through the roof.

810
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:31,340
我们从42点开始

811
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:31,340
We started at 42.

812
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,240
一路飙升到现在大概

813
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,240
Now we're up to like--

814
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,400
216点

815
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,400
216.

816
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:38,700
现象级的成功

817
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:38,700
It's phenomenal!

818
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,800
大家喜欢你

819
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,800
People love you!

820
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,500
爱慕你

821
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,500
They adore you.

822
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,700
他们想看更多更多的你

823
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,700
They want more and more and more of you.

824
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,000
所以我们决定

825
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,000
That is why we have decided

826
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,580
你将作为主持

827
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,580
that we want you

828
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:53,460
主持今年的跨年演出

829
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:53,460
to host the New Year's Eve show.

830
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:55,500
你你你你你是说……

831
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:55,500
Yoooou mean the...

832
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,400
电视网最大的演出

833
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,400
The network's biggest show.

834
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,780
五千万人在线观看

835
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,780
50 million viewers live.

836
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:02,320
你甚至能收视更高

837
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:02,320
You can't go higher than that.

838
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,060
但时间紧迫

839
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,060
That's gonna be intense.

840
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,620
只有一两个月时间准备

841
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,620
We only have a few months to pull it off, so,

842
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,900
你愿意吗？

843
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,900
are you in?

844
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:23,840
只有你给运气开了门

845
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:23,840
If you don't open the door and opportunity knocks,

846
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,440
你才能有机会抓住它

847
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,440
you won't get another chance.

848
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:28,680
你们都知道这点

849
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:28,680
You of all people know this.

850
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,650
就再要一天，然后剩下的七天交给你

851
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:43,650
Just one more day and then I have a whole week off.

852
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,850
我们换回来

853
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,850
We can switch.

854
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,560
我们得去拍《时尚》杂志的封面写真

855
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,560
We're doing the cover of Vogue.

856
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,300
就再多一天，行吗？

857
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,300
Just one more day, okay?

858
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,780
-是的 -她没有遵守平衡

859
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,780
-Yes.  -She didn't respect the balance.

860
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:21,600
她窃取了我更多的时间

861
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:21,600
She's stealing more and more time from me,

862
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:25,430
压根不计后果

863
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:25,430
completely without consideration of the consequences.

864
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,300
她就是个自私的婊子

865
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,300
She's a selfish bitch.

866
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,870
那你要终止吗？

867
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:28,870
Would you like to stop?

868
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:32,240
终止

869
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:32,240
Stop.

870
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:33,700
你是基体

871
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:33,700
You are the Matrix.

872
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,680
如果你不满意

873
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,680
If you are not satisfied,

874
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,540
你可以终止体验

875
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,540
you can put an end to the experience

876
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,950
重回自己本身

877
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,950
and go back to being just you on your own.

878
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:42,280
确定要终止吗？

879
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:42,280
Would you like to stop?

880
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:47,420
我会回到之前的样子吗？

881
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:47,420
Will it go back to the way it was before?

882
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,680
已经转换的无法返还

883
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,680
What has been transferred won't come back,

884
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,340
但你可以终止体验

885
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,340
but you can stop the experience.

886
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,560
现在，你还要终止吗？

887
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,560
As of now, would you like to stop?

888
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,860
重回自己本身

889
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,860
To go back to being just you on your own?

890
01:24:59,280 --> 01:24:59,880
不

891
01:24:59,280 --> 01:24:59,880
No.

892
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:03,500
不，不，不

893
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:03,500
No, no, no.

894
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:05,660
不能终止

895
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:05,660
I can't stop.

896
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,060
只是她……

897
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,060
She just--

898
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,940
必须要遵循平衡

899
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,940
The balance just needs to be respected.

900
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,340
那就遵循平衡

901
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,340
So respected.

902
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:27,040
停下，停下，停下，停下，停下

903
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:27,040
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

904
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,840
你是赢家

905
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,840
You are the winner.

906
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:41,420
恭喜，你已经赢得了2万5千美元奖金

907
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:41,420
Well, congratulations, you've won $25,000.

908
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,480
我们还有最后一关

909
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,480
We'll have one final chance

910
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,740
一个问答题

911
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,740
a simple question

912
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:49,040
答对了就能再进一步，或得25万美元

913
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:49,040
in our big question round and play for $250,000.

914
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,400
而这道题你只有45秒的时间作答……

915
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,400
And you'll have just 45 seconds to come up...

916
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,100
操

917
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,100
Fuck.

918
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,260
老板

919
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:26,260
Boss.

920
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,760
是的，女士们先生们，她来了！

921
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,760
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.

922
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,280
今日顶流女星，苏！

923
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,280
The superstar of the moment, Sue.

924
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,100
准备好了吗？

925
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,100
Are you ready?

926
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,780
掌声有请，苏！

927
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,780
Let's welcome her, Sue.

928
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:53,520
你像不知哪冒出来的龙卷风一样席卷所有萤幕

929
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:53,520
You popped up nowhere on our screens like a tornado.

930
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:56,930
谁都没有预料到你的出现

931
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:56,930
I don't think anybody was really prepared for this world.

932
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:07,620
从早间节目升起的新星

933
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:07,620
It all started with the morning show

934
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:12,720
有传言称你会参演汤姆格兰特的下一部电影

935
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:12,720
and rumor has it that you are up for Tom Grant's next movie.

936
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,480
稍等片刻

937
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,480
Wait, just a moment.

938
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:20,900
我被告知你将主持今年的跨年晚会

939
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:20,900
I'm being told that you are going to host the New Year's Eve show.

940
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,410
你能证实这个消息吗？

941
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,410
Can you confirm this?

942
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:23,860
是的，没错

943
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:23,860
Yes, that's right.

944
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,660
是的，没错

945
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,660
Yes, that's right.

946
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:31,240
我的天啊，重大新闻

947
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:31,240
Oh my God, that is huge news.

948
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,400
跟我们聊聊你自己吧

949
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,400
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

950
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,310
你家是哪的？

951
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,310
Where are you from?

952
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,060
怎么被挖掘出来的？

953
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,060
How did you get discovered?

954
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:41,660
我想知道，我们所有人都想知道你的一切

955
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:41,660
I want, we want to know everything.

956
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:49,020
其实，我也没什么能说的

957
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:49,020
Well, I mean, there's really not very much to tell.

958
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,620
毕竟只是一个

959
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,620
I'm just a girl from a

960
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:54,160
从印第安纳州走出来的小女孩

961
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:54,160
very small town in Indiana.

962
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:56,100
我家的小镇你们都不一定听说过

963
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:56,100
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

964
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,000
事实上，连个镇子都算不上

965
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,000
In fact, it's not even a town.

966
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:01,040
我都不确定它算不算得上村子

967
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:01,040
I'm not sure you could really even call it a village.

968
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:04,060
一个农场，可以吗？

969
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:04,060
It's a farm, perhaps?

970
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:12,600
但从我记事起

971
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:12,600
But ever since I can remember,

972
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:16,200
登上萤幕就是我的梦想

973
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:16,200
it has always been my dream to be on screen.

974
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,120
我的梦想才对

975
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,120
This is my dream.

976
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,860
小时候，我会表演节目给家人看

977
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:20,860
As a child, I used to put on shows for my family.

978
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,500
呃，你的家人

979
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,500
Mm, your family.

980
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,720
真贴心

981
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,720
How sweet.

982
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:33,940
那，大家都注意到你顶替了伊丽莎白斯巴克的位置

983
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:33,940
So, everyone is aware that you replaced Elizabeth Sparkle.

984
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:38,160
毫无疑问，你一脚插了进来

985
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:38,160
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

986
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:39,760
还把收视率提高到了不同的量级

987
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:39,760
you turned up the volume,

988
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,120
风靡全世界

989
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,120
and you rocked their world.

990
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,000
那你原来是斯巴克的粉丝吗？

991
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,000
Were you a fan of her show?

992
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:54,740
额，我，我不能，额

993
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:54,740
Um, well, well, I can't, uh,

994
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:58,920
其实不能说我看过她的节目

995
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:58,920
I can't really say that I actually watched her show.

996
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,990
要知道我们毕竟压根是不同时代的人

997
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:02,990
You do know that we're not exactly from the same generation.

998
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:05,420
必须承认的是

999
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:05,420
And you have to admit, it

1000
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:07,580
那些节目都老掉牙了

1001
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:07,580
it was a bit old-fashioned.

1002
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,840
简直是侏罗纪活化石

1003
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,840
Jurassic Fitness, really.

1004
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:15,160
它们的问题就是得与时俱进了

1005
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:15,160
the problem is it needed a change.

1006
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,000
我他妈要给你看看

1007
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,000
I'll fucking show you.

1008
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,660
你想看侏罗纪活化石？

1009
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,660
You wanna see some Jurassic Fitness?

1010
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:26,340
你想看？！

1011
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:26,340
You want it?!

1012
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:31,200
来啊，来看看你他妈的侏罗纪活化石

1013
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:31,200
Come on, come get your fucking Jurassic Fitness!

1014
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:42,080
但我母亲是她的铁粉

1015
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:42,080
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

1016
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,860
所以每个大清早，晴天雨天

1017
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,860
So, every morning, rain or shine,

1018
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,840
她的《点亮你生活》都在电视上播放着

1019
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,840
Sparkle, your life, was on TV.

1020
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,880
所以一定程度上，我是和她一起成长的

1021
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,880
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

1022
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,820
不论我喜不喜欢

1023
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,820
Whether I liked it or not.

1024
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,100
可能这也是你这么说的原因

1025
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,100
I guess that's why you could say

1026
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,840
我们有着某种联系

1027
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,840
we have some sort of connection.

1028
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,620
某种联系

1029
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,620
Some sort of connection.

1030
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:03,420
没了我你压根就不存在

1031
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:03,420
You wouldn't exist without me.

1032
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,760
邦，邦，邦，邦，邦

1033
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,760
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

1034
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:19,280
时间到了，女士们先生们，最后一个问题

1035
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:19,280
It is time, ladies and gentlemen,  for our final question.

1036
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:20,960
也是我们每个人都想问

1037
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:20,960
The question that we ask

1038
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,140
-甚至每个嘉宾都要问的问题 -好的

1039
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,140
-each and every one of our guests. -Okay.

1040
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:30,580
你能和我们稍微分享一下你的美丽秘诀吗？

1041
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:30,580
Would you share one of your little beauty secrets with us?

1042
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:33,640
稍微一点点

1043
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:33,640
Just one little trick of yours

1044
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,600
你能保持如此美貌的秘诀

1045
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,600
that helps you look so incredibly stunning.

1046
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:37,620
你本人是多么漂亮

1047
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:37,620
I mean, look at you.

1048
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:38,820
我也不知道，就……

1049
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:38,820
I don't know. Uh...

1050
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,760
说出来

1051
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,760
Say it!

1052
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,500
说出来

1053
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,500
Say it!

1054
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,480
让我想想

1055
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,480
Let me think.

1056
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,440
说出来

1057
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,440
Say it!

1058
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:47,320
告诉他们你的美丽秘诀

1059
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:47,320
Tell them who your little beauty secret is!

1060
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,160
-我想， -怎么不敢直接说啊？

1061
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,160
-I guess, -why don't you just show them right here?

1062
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:51,960
这就是你的美丽秘诀

1063
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:51,960
Here's your little beauty secret.

1064
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,770
我想我只是敢于做自己

1065
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:53,770
I guess I just try to be myself.

1066
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:57,220
真诚，感激自己拥有的一切

1067
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:57,220
To be sincere and grateful for all that I have.

1068
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,900
铭记随着自己的内心生活

1069
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,900
And to always remember to live with my heart.

1070
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:02,540
哦，甜进我心窝去了

1071
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:02,540
Oh, I'm here at the sweetheart center.

1072
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:16,600
我只是，嗯，哦，敢于做自己

1073
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:16,600
I just, woo, oh, I try to be myself.

1074
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,720
停下！

1075
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,720
Stop it!

1076
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,540
停下！

1077
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,540
Stop it.

1078
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,740
你从我这抢走了

1079
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,740
You're taking it from me.

1080
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,920
你的美是从我这抢走的

1081
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,920
That's your little secret.

1082
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:41,240
停下！停下！停下！停下！停下！停下！……

1083
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:41,240
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!......

1084
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:47,340
你必须克制你自己

1085
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:47,340
You have to control yourself!

1086
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,400
我回不去了，要是我终止……

1087
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,400
I can't go back, if I turn....

1088
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,800
哦

1089
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,800
Oh.

1090
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,220
恶心的老东西

1091
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,220
Gross old rat.

1092
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,000
停下！

1093
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,000
Stop it!

1094
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,640
“3个月后”

1095
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:15,640
“跨年晚会
明晚9点”

1096
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:32,900
“祝好运！观众会爱死你的”

1097
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,880
上床吗？

1098
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,880
Coming to bed?

1099
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:46,180
好，马上来

1100
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,160
Yes, I'll be right there.

1101
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,400
喂

1102
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,400
Yes.

1103
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:55,180
嗨，嗨，紧急情况，我……

1104
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:55,180
Hi, hi, this is emergency. There's a...

1105
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,260
我没有稳定剂了

1106
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,260
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

1107
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,080
喂？

1108
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,080
Hello?

1109
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,380
我是他妈的503号

1110
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,380
It's fucking 503.

1111
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:04,040
知道

1112
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:04,040
Yes.

1113
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,440
操！

1114
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,440
Fuck!

1115
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:06,690
我说了这是紧急情况

1116
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:06,690
I'm telling you, this is urgent.

1117
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:08,230
我稳定剂用完了

1118
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:08,230
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

1119
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,220
那说明你到最后阶段了

1120
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,220
It means you've reached the end.

1121
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:13,600
你什么意思？

1122
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:13,600
What do you mean the end?

1123
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:15,480
你已经消耗完了

1124
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:15,480
You've drained it all out.

1125
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,460
如果你还想要更多，必须等它重生

1126
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,460
If you want more, you must let the fluid regenerate.

1127
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:20,460
告诉我该怎么做

1128
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:20,460
Tell me how to do it.

1129
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,200
我现在就需要稳定自己

1130
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,200
I need to stabilize myself right now.

1131
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,000
你只需要换回来就行

1132
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,000
You simply have to switch.

1133
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:28,890
你说什么？

1134
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:28,890
Excuse me?

1135
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,880
换回来后就能开始稳定剂恢复

1136
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,880
The switch reboots the fluid secretion process

1137
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,260
然后你便能继续体验

1138
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,260
so you can continue to enjoy the experience.

1139
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:36,320
不，不，不，不，不

1140
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:36,320
No, no, no, no, no.

1141
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:38,460
我不能转换，我不能

1142
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:38,460
I can't switch, I can't.

1143
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,160
尤其是现在

1144
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,160
Especially not now.

1145
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,160
你别无选择

1146
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,160
There is no other option.

1147
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:09,420
苏？

1148
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:09,420
Sue?

1149
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:22,840
宝贝？

1150
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:22,840
Babe?

1151
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:27,120
苏？

1152
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:27,120
Sue?

1153
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:28,880
你还好吗？

1154
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:28,880
You all right?

1155
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:36,620
要不我明天再来？

1156
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:36,620
Should I start about tomorrow?

1157
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:42,700
宝贝？

1158
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:42,700
Babe?

1159
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:48,900
宝贝？

1160
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:48,900
Babe?

1161
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:57,360
苏？

1162
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:57,360
Sue?

1163
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:59,520
哪里不对劲吗？

1164
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:59,520
Is something wrong?

1165
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,780
你看起来有点暴躁不安，是工作的事儿吗？

1166
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,780
You look cranky, because your related business?

1167
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,700
苏，开下门

1168
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,700
Sue, open the door.

1169
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,200
快啊，苏？

1170
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,200
Come on, Sue.

1171
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:16,820
这不好玩，我也要小便

1172
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:16,820
not funny, I need to take a pee.

1173
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,760
苏，开门

1174
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,760
Sue, open the door.

1175
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,120
开门，苏，快开门

1176
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,120
Open the door, Sue, come on.

1177
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,860
开门，快开门

1178
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,860
Open the door, come on.

1179
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:55,140
什么玩意儿？

1180
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:55,140
What the fuck?

1181
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:58,200
给我滚开！

1182
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:58,200
Get the fuck out!

1183
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,420
你是谁？你他妈是谁？

1184
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,420
Who's this? Who the fuck is that?

1185
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,280
离我远点！

1186
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,280
Leave me alone!

1187
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:12,800
卧槽什么鬼？

1188
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:12,800
What the fuck?

1189
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:06,640
喂？

1190
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:06,640
Yes?

1191
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:11,820
我是503号

1192
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:11,820
It's 503.

1193
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,380
我想终止

1194
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,380
I want to stop.

1195
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:15,540
你确定吗？

1196
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:15,540
Are you sure?

1197
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,960
一旦终止，便不能退回了

1198
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,960
Once you stop, you can't go back.

1199
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:22,080
我想要终止！我他妈要终止！

1200
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:22,080
I want to stop! I want to fucking stop!

1201
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:24,080
我要终止！

1202
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:24,080
I want to stop!

1203
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,000
我们知道了

1204
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,000
We'll deliver.

1205
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,320
“抱歉但您未能遵守平衡”

1206
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,520
“终断剂”

1207
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,080
你确定吗？

1208
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,080
Are you sure?

1209
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,760
一旦终止，便不能退回了

1210
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,760
Once you stop, you can't go back.

1211
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,620
你会保持你自己的模样

1212
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,620
You will simply remain on your own.

1213
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:47,460
重回自身

1214
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:47,460
Just on your own.

1215
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,880
重回自身，自身，自身，自身

1216
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,880
Just on your own. on your own. on your own.

1217
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:56,300
-他妈的闭嘴！ -自身

1218
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:56,300
-Shut the fuck up! -Your own.

1219
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:57,540
好了

1220
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:57,540
Okay.

1221
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:02,680
我不能……我做不到

1222
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:02,680
I can't... I can't do this.

1223
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,960
我需要你

1224
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,960
I need you.

1225
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,220
我需要我自己

1226
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,220
I need myself.

1227
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:19,900
你，你快，你得准备好。今晚是属于我们的

1228
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:19,900
You, you got, you gotta get ready. It's our big night.

1229
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:22,790
快啊，他们会特别爱你

1230
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:22,790
Come on. They're gonna love you so much.

1231
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,340
快啊

1232
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:25,340
Come on.

1233
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:27,520
快

1234
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:27,520
Come on.

1235
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:32,360
你是我唯一被爱的部分，你必须醒过来

1236
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:32,360
You're the only lovable part of me. You have to come back.

1237
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:35,140
快醒过来，快点

1238
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:35,140
You have to come back. Come back.

1239
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:51,900
没事，没事

1240
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:51,900
Okay. Okay.

1241
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:56,820
快啊

1242
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:56,820
Come on.

1243
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,400
快啊

1244
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,400
Come on.

1245
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:10,280
快

1246
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:10,280
Come on.

1247
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:57,220
不要

1248
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:57,220
Oh, don't!

1249
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,890
“铭记
你们是一体的”

1250
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,380
你们知道发生什么了吗，化妆组？

1251
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,380
You guys know what happened, makeup?

1252
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:16,480
这人，你得跟我们去隔间

1253
01:51:14,410 --> 01:51:16,480
Here, we gotta get you the pinning room.

1254
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:19,640
还有最后一个舞台测试，灯光，音响

1255
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:19,640
We have one final test on stage, of lighting and sound.

1256
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:21,180
现在演出前我们留在外面

1257
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:21,180
now we wait outside before show starts.

1258
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:22,040
你看行吗？

1259
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:22,040
You got it?

1260
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:22,690
-嗯…… -没事吧？

1261
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:22,690
-En... -You good?

1262
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:23,820
没事，走吧

1263
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:23,820
Okay, let's go.

1264
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:32,900
真美

1265
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:32,900
Grab it.

1266
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:34,560
风韵十足

1267
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:34,560
Wonderful.

1268
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:46,360
准备惊艳全场吧

1269
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:46,360
There you go.

1270
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:54,200
还好吗？

1271
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:54,200
You good?

1272
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:56,260
你等会儿要跳舞吗，女士？

1273
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:56,260
You gonna dance, lads?

1274
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:02,820
抱歉我马上回来

1275
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:02,820
I'm gonna be right back, sorry.

1276
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,520
苏！他们要你去台上测灯光效果

1277
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,520
Sue! They need to see you on stage to test the light.

1278
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:57,800
你有没有梦想过

1279
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:57,800
Have you ever dreamt

1280
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,900
成为更华丽的自己

1281
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,900
of a better version of yourself?

1282
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,160
更美丽，更完美

1283
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,160
More beautiful, more perfect.

1284
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:05,960
苏？

1285
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:05,960
Sue?

1286
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:10,100
好的，我们舞台上见

1287
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:10,100
Yes, let me meet you there.

1288
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:12,340
没事，我们台上见

1289
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:12,340
Okay, so I'll wait for you on stage.

1290
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,420
苏？

1291
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,420
Sue?

1292
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:35,440
来见见我们的股东们

1293
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:35,440
Let me introduce you to the shareholders.

1294
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:38,480
他们对你期盼已久

1295
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:38,480
They have been dying to meet you.

1296
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:46,100
有什么问题……吗？

1297
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:46,100
Is everything...okay?

1298
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,480
那就微笑

1299
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,480
So smile.

1300
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:02,200
我们今晚就要你笑出来

1301
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:02,200
That's what we want tonight.

1302
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:07,080
尤物就该保持微笑

1303
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:07,080
Pretty girls should always smile.

1304
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:23,260
羽毛诱惑！羽毛诱惑！羽毛诱惑！

1305
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:23,260
Feathers! feathers! feathers!

1306
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:17,120
嘿，准备好了吗？

1307
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:17,120
Hey, you ready for tonight?

1308
01:57:06,130 --> 01:57:08,080
你能成为更华丽的自己吗？

1309
01:57:06,130 --> 01:57:08,080
Would you be the better version of myself?

1310
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:11,380
请让我更美丽，求求了！

1311
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:11,380
Please give me a better version of myself, please!

1312
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:18,400
求求了！

1313
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:18,400
Please!

1314
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:21,720
变美！

1315
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:21,720
Come on!

1316
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:19,820
这次感觉各方面都完美无瑕啊

1317
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:19,820
Looks like everything sure is in the right place this time.

1318
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:24,320
请告诉我们你的姓名，年龄，三围

1319
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:24,320
Please say your name, age, measurements.

1320
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,600
我叫……

1321
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,600
I'm...

1322
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,540
我叫……

1323
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,540
I'm...

1324
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,200
“怪物伊丽杀苏”

1325
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:25,600
尤物就该保持微笑

1326
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:25,600
Pretty girls should always smile.

1327
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:01,770
可出来了，我们都等急了

1328
02:03:00,180 --> 02:03:01,770
At last, we're starting to worry.

1329
02:03:01,870 --> 02:03:03,590
快点，从五号机位前上台

1330
02:03:01,870 --> 02:03:03,590
Hurry up, you're up in five.

1331
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:23,780
她来了，真美啊

1332
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:23,780
There she is, so beautiful.

1333
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,160
我们爱你

1334
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,160
We love you.

1335
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:29,400
这才是你的舞台

1336
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:29,400
This is where you belong.

1337
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,080
这永远都是你的舞台

1338
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,080
You always belong here.

1339
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:32,340
没有你我们什么都不是

1340
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:32,340
We can't do it without you.

1341
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:34,380
没有你我们一事无成

1342
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:34,380
We'll never do it without you.

1343
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,620
你会把所有人比下去

1344
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,620
You are here to replace them all?

1345
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:05,880
女士们，快，上台

1346
02:04:04,460 --> 02:04:05,880
Girls, come on, let's go.

1347
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:06,920
还在等什么？

1348
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:06,920
What are we waiting for?

1349
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:10,140
-快啊！ -都快点，快走，快走

1350
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:10,140
-come on! -Everybody, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1351
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,620
你肯定不会失望

1352
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,620
You will not be disappointed.

1353
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,380
她可是我最美丽杰作

1354
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:18,380
She's my most beautiful creation.

1355
02:04:18,380 --> 02:04:20,800
是我一手造就了她

1356
02:04:18,380 --> 02:04:20,800
I have shaped her for success.

1357
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:32,700
五，四，三，二，一

1358
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:32,700
Five, four, three, two, one.

1359
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:39,520
“开播”

1360
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:29,400
怪物！

1361
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:29,400
The monster!

1362
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:39,260
快杀了它！

1363
02:07:37,480 --> 02:07:39,260
Shoot the monster!

1364
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:41,940
怪胎！

1365
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:41,940
It's a freak!

1366
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:44,600
快杀了它！

1367
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:44,600
Shoot the monster!

1368
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:47,980
-别怕-怪物！

1369
02:07:45,780 --> 02:07:47,980
-Don't be scared. -Monster!

1370
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:49,500
是我啊！

1371
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:49,500
It's still me!

1372
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:50,930
是我！

1373
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:50,930
It's me.

1374
02:07:51,870 --> 02:07:54,620
我是伊丽莎白，我是苏……

1375
02:07:51,870 --> 02:07:54,620
I'm Elizabeth, I'm Sue.

1376
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:00,820
怪胎！

1377
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:00,820
Freak!

1378
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:17,780
怪胎，怪物，怪物！

1379
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:17,780
Freak, monster, monster!

1380
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:22,160
是我啊

1381
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:22,160
It's me.

1382
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:25,740
是我啊

1383
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:25,740
It's me.

1384
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:36,900
不，我只是……

1385
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:36,900
No I'm just...

1386
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:35,480
可惜不能像看她脸一样直接看她那对奶子

1387
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:35,480
Too bad her boobs aren't in the middle of her face instead of that nose.

1388
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,660
下一位！

1389
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,660
Next!

1390
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:48,980
尤物就该保持微笑

1391
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:48,980
Pretty girls should always smile.

1392
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:55,100
50岁后

1393
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:55,100
at 50.

1394
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:56,860
就绝经了

1395
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:56,860
It stops.

1396
02:12:57,800 --> 02:12:59,100
真漂亮

1397
02:12:57,800 --> 02:12:59,100
So beautiful

1398
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:01,280
我们爱你

1399
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:01,280
We love you.
