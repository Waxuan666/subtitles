弗雷德不会有事的 别再争论了
Fred's gonna be fine. No more argument, okay?

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,400
这事讨论的没完没了
We've discussed this ad nauseam.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,920
没完没了是什么意思
What's ad nauseam?

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,320

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,970
尽量跟别的孩子一样
I don't know. Try bein' a kid.

弗兰克
Frank!

51
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,970
你现在补救还来得及
There's still time for you to undo this nonsense.

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,520
开车去把孩子接回来
Go get in your car and go get that child.

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,960
我允许你可以

54
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,480
随时用这钥匙了吗
use those keys whenever you want?

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,240
你怎么能
How can you stand there...

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,650
这么淡定
acting all calm and everything, Frank,

57
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,760
对此毫不在乎呢
and make light of this?

58
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,600
去把她接回来 趁现在还来得及
Now go get her back before it's too late.

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,850
她得去外面的世界
She gotta get out in the world.

60
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,960
她没有同龄的朋友

61
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,440
没有社交技能

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,480
不知道该怎么做个孩子
She doesn't know how to be a kid.

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,050
前天晚上 她对我说
Two nights ago, she told me

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,530
即使德国脱欧
that even if Germany bails out the euro...

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,880
还是有可能发生全球经济衰退

我盯着天花板三个小时

68
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,280

If you start crying,

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,280
我就只能装哭了
I'm gonna have to pretend to start crying.

71
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,760

有些事是可以不在乎的
You know, there's something you could be overlookin'.

73
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,320
她没事的
This could work out.

74
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,000
可能吧
Maybe.

75
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,000
但如果她被谁带走了
But if anybody takes that baby away...

76
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,440
我会让你死在睡梦里
I'll smother you in your sleep.

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,120
勾搭他啊
Trying to get picked up by him.

147
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,880
等一下 你好
Excuse me? Hi.

148
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,440
是我老师
Oh. Look, it's my teacher.

149
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,330
可能是想问我1加1等于几
Probably wants to remind mewhat one plus one is.

150
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,440
你到车上去
Go to the car, okay?

151
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,840
- 你好 - 你好
- Hi.- Hi.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,530
对不起冲你喊还追出来
Sorry to yell at you and then chase you down.

153
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,640
没关系 你是玛丽的老师?
It's okay. Mary's teacher?

154
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,000
是的 我叫邦妮史蒂文森
Yes. I'm Bonnie Stevenson.

155
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,640
我叫弗兰克 你好 今天的事很抱歉
Frank. How are you? Sorry about today.

156
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,170
她有点兴奋过头
I know she got a little overexcited.

157
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,450
可能因为第一天上学吧
I think it's just first day jitters.

158
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,520
是啊
Sure. Yeah.

159
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,250
我们有点晚了 我们该走了
We're running a little late actually. We gotta get going.

160
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,560
我想说的不是那事
Okay. I don't even wanna talk about that.

161
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
- 我只耽误你一会 - 好的
- I'll keep you just a minute.- Okay.

162
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,320
我觉得你女儿
I think your daughter...

163
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,800
我觉得玛丽可能是天才
I think Mary might be gifted.

164
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,000
什么
What?

165
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,160
今天在数学课上 她回答了一些非常难的
Yeah. Today in Math, she answered some really...

166
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,080
- 不 不 - 请听我说
- Oh, no, no, no. That's... - No, please.

167
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,410
- 那不是天才 - 非常难的问题
- It's not gifted.- Really difficult questions.

168
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,480
好
All right.

169
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,850
一个7岁的孩子
Just that a seven-year-old would...

170
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
这是特拉亨伯格
It's Trachtenberg.

171
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,120
- 特拉亨伯格速算法 - 什么
- Jakow Trachtenberg.- I'm sorry?

172
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,480
他在纳粹集中营里待了7年
Spent seven years in a Nazi concentration camp.

173
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,520
发明了一种速算系统
Developed a system to rapidly solve problems.

174
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,800
叫做特拉亨伯格方法
It's the Trachtenberg method.

175
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,320
可她
But she's...

176
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,880
她毕竟才7岁
I mean, she's seven though.

177
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,450
我8岁时候就学会了
I learned it when I was eight.

178
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,400
看我像天才吗
Do I look gifted to you?

179
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,360
自从发明了计算器
It's kind of gone out of vogue

180
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,640
这种方法就过时了 不过
since the invention of the calculator...

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,200
我在酒吧里还是能够靠它赢酒喝
but, uh, I can still win a drink at a bar using it.

182
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,840
今天的事很抱歉
Sorry for today.

183
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,160
- 她不会再犯了 - 好
- Won't happen again.- Okay.

184
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,360
很高兴认识你 邦妮
Nice to meet you. Bonnie.

185
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,520
弗兰克
Frank.

186
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,090
我要说明 我本来就不想
For the record, I didn't wanna go

187
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
上那个破学校
to the stupid school in the first place.

188
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,290
我后排的男生
And the boy in the next row

189
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,040
行为不检点 没个孩子样
acts inappropriately for someone who's a child.

190
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,320
抱歉 我还是要无视你
I'm sorry. I'm still passive aggressively ignoring you.

191
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,690
别的同学也回答问题了 没受处分啊
Other kids answer questions.They don't get into trouble.

192
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,000
你受处分不是因为回答问题
You didn't get in trouble for answering questions.

193
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,520
是因为冲校长发脾气
You yelled at the principal.

194
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,840
知道吗 你会觉得这个有意思
You know what? You're gonna find this interesting.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,280
我搜索了一下 一年级学生冲校长发脾气
So, I googled "first graders who yell at the principal..."

196
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,730
你绝对想不到
and statistically,you're never gonna

197
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,120
有多少学生这么干过
believe how many kids do it.

198
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
有多少
How many?

199
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,640
0个
None.

200
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,080
弗兰克 我很抱歉 真的
Frank, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

201
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,480
得了吧
Yeah, right.

202
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,280
你在学校里不能那么炫耀
You can't show off like that at school.

203
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,640
我知道
I know.

204
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,680
你保证过不会 但你第一天就…
You promised you wouldn't, then the first day...

205
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,760
我知道 是我的不对
I know, I know. I screwed up.

206
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,320
你觉得这条船需要试航吗
Do you think maybe this boat needs a test ride?

207
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,400
去把弗雷德抱来
Go get Fred.

208
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,090
不要跑
Don't run.

209
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,630
我聆听风的声音 越过我灵魂的风声
∮ I listen to the wind To the wind of my soul ∮

210
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,190
我将会在哪里停下我的脚步 我想
∮ Where I'll end up Well, I think ∮

211
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,820
只有上帝才知道吧
∮ Only God really knows ∮

212
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,950
我曾坐在烈日下
∮ I've sat upon the setting sun ∮

213
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,110
但是我从未 从未
∮ But never, never, never, never ∮

214
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,150
渴望过水源
∮ I never wanted water once ∮

215
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,070
不我从未那样过
∮ No, never, never, never ∮

216
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,810
弗雷德很喜欢看矶鹬
Fred loves to watch the sandpipers.

217
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,720
它想去抓一只
He thinks he'd like to catch one...

218
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,480
但它会后悔的
but he'd regret it.

219
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,320
弗雷德不杀小动物
Fred's not a killer.

220
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,970
它有爱心
He's a lover.

221
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,640
妈妈会希望我上这学校吗
Would my mom have wanted me to go to this school?

222
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,480
我说不好
I can only guess.

223
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
但我跟你说
But I'll tell you what,

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,720
她肯定希望你交些朋友
she would have wanted you to have friends.

225
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,720
傻瓜朋友吗
Idiot friends?

226
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,840
她还会希望你对人有同情心
And she'd want you to have compassion for others.

227
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,890
就像猫对矶鹬那样
Like a cat can have for a sandpiper.

228
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
如果同学们不喜欢我呢
But what if they don't like me?

229
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,280
那他们是傻瓜
Then they're idiots.

230
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,280
早上好 同学们
Good morning, class.

231
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,160
早上好 史蒂文森老师
Good morning, Ms. Stevenson.

232
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,160
早上好 玛丽
Good morning, Mary.

233
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,160
早上好 史蒂文森老师
Good morning, Ms. Stevenson.

234
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,040
好 早上好
Okay, good morning.

235
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,970
你规矩点
Get a hold of yourself.

236
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,440
我展示和讲述的内容
For my Show and Tell,I have...

237
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,920
是一只特别棒的猫
the most awesome cat in the history of time.

238
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,520
它不光名字叫弗雷德 而且
Not only is his name Fred, but...

239
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,200
它只有一只眼
He has just one eye.

240
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,400
一只眼 不信数数看
Uno. Go ahead and count...

241
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,760
反正数来数去就是一只
but I promise you, it's always one.

242
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,440
它怎么失去一只眼的
How did he lose his eye?

243
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,840
不知道 我当时不在
I don't know. I wasn't there.

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,440
我是在一个垃圾桶旁边捡到它的
Just found him inside of a trash can

245
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,520
在一瓶酒旁边
next to a bottle of alcohol or something.

246
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,880
它是一只聪明的猫 但没人发现这一点
He is a smart, smart cat, but no one realizes that.

247
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,680
没人能理解它 没人
No one understands him. No one.

248
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
把名字写在试卷上方
Put your name on the top of the paper...

249
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,730
我就知道是谁回答的这么好了
so that I know who did such good work.

250
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,120
我给你我的笔
I left my pen with you.

251
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,610
把试卷传递一下
Pass those around, guys.

252
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,290
好吗 我想看看你们的解答
Okay? I wanna see your work.

253
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,480
转过身去 面对课桌
Turn around, face the desk.

254
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,280
考虑一下答案是怎么得出来的
Think about how you get to the answer.

255
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,280
不要只是猜
It's not just about, you know, guessing.

256
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,850
试卷要整洁
Don't be messy.

257
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,800
做完了
Done.

258
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,520
我看看
Let's see.

259
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,170
嗯
Mmm-hmm.

260
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,130
我估计你会很快做完
Okay. I thought you might finish quickly,

261
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,690
所以给你加了一些题
so a little something extra.

262
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,520
做完了
Done.

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,200
啊
Oh...

264
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,320
你知道我是谁吗
Do you know who I am?

265
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,960
嗨 玛丽的老师
Hey! Mary's teacher...

266
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,240
邦妮
Bonnie.

267
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,000
你对我撒了谎
You lied to me.

268
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,080
好吧
Okay.

269
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,120
你能具体些吗
Can you narrow it down?

270
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,520
我想了解我的学生玛丽的真相
I'd like to know the truth about Mary, my student...

271
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
你的外甥女
your niece.

272
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,320
我当时
I was running

273
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,680
赶着去约会
ridiculously late for a date...

274
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,920
我姐姐带着玛丽来了
and my sister showed up with Mary.

275
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,760
她从来不会不请自来
And she never just showed up unannounced.

276
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,360
从未带孩子来过
She never showed up with the baby.

277
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,200
她说她想聊聊
She said she wanted to talk.

278
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,010
她说她也需要聊聊
She said she needed to talk.

279
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,920
我说等我回来后再谈
I told her I would talk to her when I got back.

280
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,120
我想着如果约会晚了那么久
I think I figured showing up that late to my date...

281
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,040
滚床单的机会就不大了
would hurt my chances of gettin' laid.

282
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,680
那晚回来时 玛丽在沙发上
Came home that night and Mary was on the couch...

283
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,520
而戴安死在了卫生间地板上
and found Diane on the bathroom floor.

284
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,960
我完全没料到她会…
I mean, there's no way I could known...

285
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,600
但我本该料到的
but I should known.

286
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,480
六年半后
Six and a half years later,

287
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,080
我还是和玛丽在一起
me and Mary are still hangin' out.

288
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,680
那她父亲呢
And what about the father?

289
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,280
黛安不善交际
Diane was so socially awkward...

290
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,170
不善辨别好男人和坏男人
she didn't date enough to know a good guy from a bad guy.

291
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,800
他们交往一个月就分手了
This particular guy didn't last a month.

292
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,640
没有外祖父母吗
And no grandparents?

293
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,760
我爸在我8岁时去世 我妈…
Dad died when I was eight. My mom...

294
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,960
简单的说 在黛安怀孕后
Short version is she turned her back on Diane

295
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,240
她就不管她了
when she got pregnant.

296
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
为什么
Why?

297
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,200
不符合她的计划
Didn't fit into her plan.

298
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,130
我妈是个很严格的人
She's an exacting woman, my mother.

299
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,080
不妥协
Uncompromising.

300
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,200
典型的英国人
Very British.

301
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,120
是举止很英式 还是…
Do you mean, British in demeanor or...

302
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,360
- 不 她就是… - 是英国人
- No. Like she's... - She's from England.

303
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,200
英国人 对
From England. Yeah.

304
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,440
那么玛丽确实是天才喽?
So, Mary is a genius?

305
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,450
啊
Oh!

306
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,110
当心 当心
Look out. Look out.

307
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,040
你的小动物们要跑了 笨蛋
Your little animals are escaping, dumbass.

308
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,120
喂 你不该笑的
Hey! You should not be laughing!

309
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,360
你欺负小孩子
You did a mean thing to a little kid!

310
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,080
你能把我怎么样
What are you gonna do about it?

311
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,170
喂 你没事吧
Hey. Hey, you okay?

312
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,720
没事吧 好
You good? All right.

313
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,810
这事怎么解决
How do we resolve this?

314
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,480
她够被开除了
You know, she could be expelled.

315
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,360
天啊 希望不要开除
God. I hope not.

316
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,720
但如果别的学生第一次违纪就被开除
But if every other first-time offender was expelled,

317
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,880
那么就这么办
I guess fair is fair.

318
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,720
你能不能认真点
Are you gonna take this seriously?

319
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,480
好的 只要你实实在在的 我也实实在在的
Sure. You don't bluff me, I don't bluff you.

320
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,640
史蒂文森老师说
Ms. Stevenson believes

321
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,680
你的孩子很超常
that your child is exceptional...

322
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,440
我们的课程对她来说
and has talents that our curriculum

323
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,040
完全没有挑战性
can't begin to challenge.

324
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,000
我恰巧
It just so happens

325
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,240
有位好朋友
that I am good friends with the headmaster

326
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,130
是橡树天才教育学院的校长
of the Oaks Academy for Gifted Education.

327
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,520
他经常说
He has always said

328
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,560
如果我能碰到万里挑一的神童
that if I find that one in a million...

329
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,720
那种万里挑一的学费要三万美元呢
And the one in a million has a $30,000 tuition.

330
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,520
阿德勒先生 我可以为你女儿申请奖学金
Mr. Adler, I can get your daughter a scholarship.

331
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,760
全额的
Full ride.

332
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,920
我有把握才说这个话
I wouldn't say it if I couldn't do it.

333
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,720
我知道把这女孩送到那种学校
I realize, putting that girl in that setting,

334
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,920
是你们最通常的做法
you know, 99 times out of a 100, that's what you do.

335
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,440
那可是橡树学校 是一流的学校
It's the Oaks. It's a great school.

336
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,680
我搜索过
I looked into it.

337
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,840
但我们家族有好几人去过这种学校
But this family has a history with those schools.

338
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,720
我觉得她最不需要的
And I think the last thing that little girl needs

339
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,320
就是强化她的与众不同感
is reinforcement that she's different.

340
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
相信我 她有这感觉 所以
Trust me, she knows. So...

341
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,240
我觉得玛丽必须留在这学校
I think Mary, I think she's gotta be here.

342
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,680
今天的事不好 动手打人是不对的
Today's a bad ending. You can't hit people.

343
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,960
但一个12岁的男生欺负一个7岁男生
But a 12-year-old bullies a seven- year- old

344
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,370
她能挺身而出
and she stands up?

345
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,130
她这么做你知道我有多欣慰吗
Do you know how important it is to me that she did that?

346
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,360
知道我有多骄傲吗 你们难道不是吗
You know how proud I am of her? Aren't you?

347
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,840
阿德勒先生 你女儿把一个男生打得…
Mr. Adler, your daughter shattered a young boy's...

348
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
我知道 打人是不对的
I know. You can't hit people.

349
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,320
我会跟她明确这一点 这我懂
That will be made very clear. I get that.

350
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,130
但如果把未来的领导人和普通人分开
But Mrs. Davis, if we separate our leaders,

351
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,760
让他们脱离我们这样的群众
if we segregate them from people like you and me,

352
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
他们就会成为政客
you get congressmen.

353
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
所以我很抱歉
So, I'm sorry.

354
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,480
我也很想接受你的提议 但我不能
I wish I could take your offer, but Mary stays.

355
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,720
除非你把她开除
Unless you kick her out.

356
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,730
这是错误的 我们无法给她提供
This is a mistake. We'll never be able to raise this child

357
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,520
她所需要的教育水平
to the level of scholarship she deserves.

358
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,810
让她降低到普通人的水平就行了
Well, just dumb her down into a decent human being.

359
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,400
这样都满意
Everybody wins.

360
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,600
我先离开一下
You know what? Can you excuse me one minute?

361
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,280
把她所有的档案材料
Bring me every piece of paperwork

362
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,760
拿给我
we have on this girl.

363
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
喂
Hey.

364
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,520
你觉得这么做真的好吗
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

365
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
不知道
No.

366
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,920
好了 玛丽
Okay. Mary, I think

367
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,650
你是不是有话要对同学们说
you have something you'd like to say to the class.

368
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,920
你上台来说吧
You wanna hop up and say it?

369
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,640
好吧 我该说点什么
Okay. I'm supposed to say something.

370
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,160
打人是不对的 即使打的是坏人
Hitting people is wrong even if they're bad.

371
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,210
我不会再打人了 所以不用怕我
I won't do it again, so don't be afraid of me.

372
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,760
好 谢谢你
Okay. Thank you.

373
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,360
我能说句真心话吗
Now can I say something I wanna say?

374
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
好的
Sure.

375
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,170
在摔坏之前
Before they ruined it,

376
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,890
贾斯汀做的动物园是最棒的
Justin's zoo was the best art project.

377
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,090
暂时没人超过 做得特别棒
By far. It was awesome.

378
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,830
来吧 用力鼓掌
Come on. A little harder.

379
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,040
好的
Okay.

380
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,370
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

381
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,120
有个女人站在我们家门前
There's a lady standing in front of our door.

382
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,360
是谁啊
Who is it?

383
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,720
我哪知道 我才7岁
How should I know? I'm seven.

384
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,830
她是你外婆
That would be your grandmother.

385
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,320
我嘞个去
Holy shit!

386
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,200
苹果 哇
An Apple? Whoa.

387
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,440
是个苹果笔记本电脑 孩子
It's a MacBook, darling.

388
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,000
是最先进的 有视网膜显示屏
Top of the line with the Retina Display.

389
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,000
你知道谁也有视网膜显示屏吗
Hey, you know who else has a Retina Display?

390
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,120
弗雷德
Fred!

391
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,160
玛丽 我听说你喜欢数学
Mary, I understand you like mathematics.

392
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,120
所以在这电脑里
So, on there,

393
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,360
你能找到一本
you'll find a great

394
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,920
查尔斯奇默写的绝版书
out-of-print book by Charles Zimmer

395
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,680
名叫 高等代数的演变
called Transitions in Advanced Algebra.

396
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,440
是啊 我喜欢那本书
Yeah. Love that book.

397
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,520
你是说你看过
You're saying you've read it?

398
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,800
看过 我已经转向研究微分方程了
Yeah. I've kind of moved on to differential equations now.

399
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,120
要注意礼貌 谢谢你外婆
Don't forget your manners. Thank your grandma.

400
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,520
谢谢你 外婆
Thank you, Grandma.

401
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,410
叫我外婆或伊芙琳都可以
Grandmother or Evelyn will do just fine.

402
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,360
里面远不止这本书
There's so much more on there.

403
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,280
你肯定能找到有难度的
Things I know you'll find really challenging.

404
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,040
是的 但可惜她明天还要上学
Yes. But sadly, it's a school night

405
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,450
今晚要做作业
and there's homework to do.

406
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,960
真是个意外的惊喜
What a surprise though, right?

407
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,960
跟你外婆或伊芙琳道别吧
Say good night to Grandmother or Evelyn.

408
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,120
再见
Good night.

409
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,720
我现在特想吃药
I'd kill a priest for a Benadryl.

410
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,210
还是过敏吗
Still with the allergies?

411
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,200
你干嘛养猫
Why in God's name have you got a cat?

412
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,440
你又不喜欢猫
You don't even like cats.

413
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,200
不是我的猫 是玛丽的猫
It's not my cat. It's Mary's cat.

414
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,690
我只是搭顺风车
I'm just along for the ride.

415
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,840
我来猜猜
So let me guess.

416
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,570
是戴维斯校长请你来的吧
Our lovely principal, Ms. Davis.

417
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,960
千万别得罪
Never get on the bad side of small-minded people

418
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,480
有点实权的小人
who have a little authority.

419
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,290
我记得教过你这一点
I thought I taught you that.

420
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,040
你来干什么
What are you doin' here?

421
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,250
难道我没权利
You don't think I have the right

422
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,320
来看望我外孙女吗
to see my granddaughter?

423
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,760
你有 我很欣慰你历尽千辛万苦
I do. I'm thrilled your seven-year exhaustive search

424
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,320
终于在七年后找到了外孙女
has finally come to a fruitful conclusion.

425
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,130
我觉得现在说话不方便
I don't think this is an appropriate time to talk.

426
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,400
至少这里不方便
Certainly not the setting.

427
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,560
等你回来的时候 一只这么大的蟑螂
While I was waiting, a cockroach this big

428
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,440
想偷走我的鞋
tried to steal my shoe.

429
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,600
是啊 它们会偷鞋
Yeah. They'll take a shoe.

430
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,640
说真的 就这里吗
Honestly, this?

431
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,640
住在这荒凉的蚊子农场是理性的选择吗
This godforsaken mosquito ranch was a conscious choice?

432
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,760
我可以开车送你去机场
I could drop you back off at the airport.

433
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,840
这里面好多很棒的数学题
This thing is loaded with cool problems.

434
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,560
你在任教吗
So, are you teaching?

435
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,960
我是修船的
I repair boats.

436
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,680
- 别胡说 - 我手艺还不赖
- Please. - I'm not bad at it either.

437
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,600
难怪你皮肤粗糙
Well, then, that explains this.

438
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,880
这里不卖防晒霜吗
They don't sell sunscreen here?

439
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,080
我擦了防晒霜
I wear sunscreen.

440
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,480
擦得不够 你还要戴上帽子
Not enough. And you need a hat.

441
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,400
能让脸和脖子不被晒的大帽子
A big hat that shades your face and neck.

442
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,330
不能拿自己的皮肤开玩笑
You're playing Russian roulette with your skin.

443
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,690
你跟个A片制片人似的
You look like a porn producer.

444
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,360
好的 我谢谢你的建议
Okay. I appreciate the advice. I do.

445
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,410
但我们不是来谈防晒霜的吧
But we're not here to talk about sunscreen, are we?

446
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,200
闲聊几句也不行吗 那太遗憾了
Oh, so no more small talk? That's a shame.

447
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,920
好吧 你为那孩子创造的环境
Okay. The environment you have created for that child

448
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,800
她的住处 她上的学校
where she lives, the school she attends,

449
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,200
都是配不上她的
it's substandard, every bit of it.

450
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,640
我不赞同
I disagree.

451
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,760
我们要互相坦诚
We're getting nowhere

452
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,970
否则根本谈不出什么结果来
if we're not gonna be honest with each other.

453
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,760
我没不坦诚
I am being honest.

454
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,320
好吧 不带走她 我是不会走的
I see. Fine. Well, I'm not leaving without her.

455
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,120
那你就住在佛罗里达吧
Well, welcome to Florida.

456
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,440
弗兰克 请你理智一点
Frank, please listen to reason.

457
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,920
总有一天 你要么自己想明白了
At some point, either you're gonna come to the conclusion,

458
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,080
要么法院会派人
or someone in authority

459
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,290
跟你逐字逐句的讲明白
is going to spell it out for you

460
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,600
这孩子的利益才是最重要的
that the child's best interest is all that matters.

461
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,120
既然你不客气 我也跟你直说了
You're gonna make me pull rank, I will.

462
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,690
黛安不想把她交给你
Diane didn't want you to have her.

463
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,560
黛安
Diane...

464
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,160
黛安考虑事情不够周全
Diane didn't always think things through.

465
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,250
她可是世上最聪明的人之一
Arguably one of the brightest minds on the planet.

466
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,520
可这为她带来了什么呢
Good luck going down that road.

467
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,810
如果她看到
And what do you think she'd say

468
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,960
孩子住在这种地方 她会怎么说
if she saw how her child is living now?

469
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,040
你真以为她会满意吗
Do you honestly think she'd be pleased?

470
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,720
看着孩子过着平常的生活 她当然满意
That she's living a somewhat normal life? Yes. I do.

471
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,840
她不是平常的孩子 把她当成平常的孩子
She's not normal. And treating her as such...

472
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,720
是你的重大过失
is negligence on a grand scale.

473
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,400
我知道你是出于好心
I know your heart's in the right place on this.

474
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,120
但你这是耽误了她的潜力
But you are denying the girl her potential. You are.

475
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,240
我可以提供给她 我可以丰富她的人生
I can provide for her, I can enrich her life.

476
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,280
得了吧 伊芙琳 你要把她带走
Oh, come on, Evelyn. You're gonna take that girl,

477
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,490
让她上无数的学习班
you're gonna bury her in tutors...

478
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,370
然后让她去某个研究机构工作
then you're gonna loan her out to some think tank...

479
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,970
让她一辈子
where she can talk non-trivial zeros...

480
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,130
跟一群俄国老头子谈论非平凡零点
with a bunch of old Russian guys for the rest of her life.

481
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,960
而你会埋没她
And you'd bury her under a rock.

482
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,650
你不明白要成为伟人
Look, I don't expect you to understand

483
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,280
都是要付出代价的
the price you have to pay for greatness.

484
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,360
我明白 否则玛丽也就不会归我抚养了
Oh, I do. That's why I have Mary in the first place.

485
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,250
没必要说这种话吧
That's uncalled for.

486
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,640
你姐姐有很多问题
Your sister had a laundry list of problems.

487
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,010
她本来有希望解决纳维尔-斯托克斯方程
She could have solved Navier-Stokes

488
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,120
青史留名
and gone down in history...

489
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,120
成为史上最伟大的数学家之一
as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.

490
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,360
可她没有 因为她没能做下去
But she didn't because she couldn't finish.

491
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,960
她软弱
She was weak.

492
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,920
像她的父亲那样 像她的…
Weak like her father and weak like...

493
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,320
好吧
Well...

494
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
如果你说的是我
Now, if it's who I think it is...

495
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,360
这顿饭就吃的没什么滋味了
Kinda puts a black cloud over our luncheon.

496
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,330
你还是那么倔强 怀恨在心
You're still stubborn and vindictive.

497
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,640
这种话别随便说
Careful, Mother.

498
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,200
俗话说有其母必有其子
There's an apple and tree analogy lurking.

499
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,640
你们可以点菜了吗
You guys ready to order?

500
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,840
我有个提议
Here's an idea.

501
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,800
别再考虑你和我
Stop thinking about me and you...

502
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,280
考虑一下怎么样才对孩子最好吧
and start thinking about what's best for the child.

503
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,000
对任何理性的人来说 答案都是明显的
For any reasonable person, a clear picture will emerge.

504
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,040
如果不是 我建议你打电话给律师
If it doesn't, I suggest you call your attorney.

505
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,200
他会喝上一桶啤酒
He'll have the bucket of beer.

506
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,320
我们到外面玩玩吧
Hey, let's go outside.

507
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,480
不
No.

508
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,600
拜托 外面多好玩啊
Come on. It's nice out.

509
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,200
我没兴趣
I don't care.

510
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,290
喂 今天别再看数学了
Hey, no more math today.

511
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,240
上帝存在吗
Is there a God?

512
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,730
不知道
I don't know.

513
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,160
你就告诉我
Just tell me.

514
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,080
知道的话我会告诉你的
I would if I could.

515
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,840
可我不知道 没人知道
But I don't know. And neither does anybody else.

516
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,610
罗伯塔知道
Roberta knows.

517
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,160
不 罗伯塔那是信仰
No. Roberta has faith

518
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,840
这是好事
and that's a great thing to have.

519
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,840
但信仰归信仰
But faith's about what you think, feel.

520
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,250
不等于知道
Not what you know.

521
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,400
那么耶稣呢
What about Jesus?

522
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,760
他是好人 要听他的教诲
Love that guy. Do what he says.

523
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
可他是上帝吗
But is he God?

524
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,600
不知道
I don't know.

525
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,200
我虽然有观点
I have an opinion.

526
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,520
但只是我个人观点 不一定对
But that's my opinion. I could be wrong.

527
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,400
所以不能误导你
So why would I screw up yours?

528
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,120
可以自己考虑
Use your head.

529
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,680
但也可以盲目的信仰
But don't be afraid to believe in things either.

530
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,720
电视上有个人说
Huh. There was a guy on TV

531
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,400
上帝并不存在
who said there was no God.

532
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,960
那个无神论者
The only difference

533
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,640
和罗伯塔唯一的区别在于
between the atheists on TV and Roberta...

534
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,920
罗伯塔是爱你的 她想帮你
is that Roberta loves you. She's trying to help.

535
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,120
不过呢
Tell you what though.

536
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,840
不管是否存在
One way or another,

537
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,960
我们最后都是在一起的
we all end up back together in the end.

538
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,360
这就是你要问的吧
That's what you're asking, right?

539
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,360
是的
Yep.

540
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,840
好
Okay.

541
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,640
这一点你就不用担心了 好吗
Find something else to worry about, will you?

542
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,440
好的
All right.

543
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,530
好 阿德勒 外婆和舅舅
Okay. Adler, grandmother and uncle.

544
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,880
真的吗
Really?

545
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,280
你们真的不打算
You sure you folks don't wanna go out

546
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,600
庭外和解吗
in the hallway and settle this?

547
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,240
那可太遗憾了
No? Well, that's a shame.

548
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,040
卡伦先生 你是这舅舅的律师
Mr. Cullen, you are here for the uncle.

549
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,360
是的 法官大人
Yes, sir, Your Honor.

550
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,010
开始挣你的食宿费了
Start charging you room and board.

551
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,200
海史密斯先生
Mr. Highsmith,

552
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,160
你也是实在太穷了吧
you're on the wrong side of the bay, aren't you?

553
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,970
我很高兴来这里 法官大人
I'm very happy to be here, Your Honor.

554
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,160
声明一下 狄本思夫人
For the record, Mrs. Dibbons

555
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,570
代表佛罗里达州
is representing the State of Florida

556
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,840
儿童福利部门
Child Welfare Department.

557
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,080
开庭
Proceed.

558
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,960
法官大人 我的当事人阿德勒夫人
Your Honor, my client, Mrs. Adler

559
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,640
是这孩子的外婆
is the maternal grandmother of the child.

560
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,090
她女儿 这女孩的母亲
Her daughter, the girl's mother,

561
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,200
患有精神疾病
was a troubled woman...

562
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,520
7年前很不幸的自杀了
who seven years ago, sadly, took her own life.

563
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,640
当时 阿德勒先生
It was at this time that Mr. Adler

564
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,160
抢先而且是非法的
preemptively and illegally...

565
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,600
占据了孩子的监护权
took custody of the girl

566
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,010
带她离开州境
and spirited her across state lines...

567
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,400
以阻止我的当事人行使监护权
for the purpose of denying my client custody.

568
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,080
有证据表明 这孩子目前生活在
Now, there is evidence that the child currently lives...

569
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,050
不干净不健康的环境里
in unclean and unwholesome conditions.

570
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,120
我们请求法庭把孩子的监护权
We petition the court to grant my client

571
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,320
完全判给我的当事人
full custody of the child...

572
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,560
使她能回到
so that she may be returned

573
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,970
马萨诸塞州
to the state of Massachusetts...

574
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,480
得到她应得的照顾
and given the care to which she is entitled.

575
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,040
我的当事人领养这孩子只有一个原因
My client took an infant under his wing for one reason only.

576
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,120
就是这是他姐姐的遗愿
It was his sister's desire that he do so.

577
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,360
我的当事人一直都是她的照顾者
My client has been her constant caregiver.

578
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,450
法官大人 至于孩子的生活环境
And, Your Honor, as far as the living conditions...

579
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,000
我去过他的家 没有问题
I've been in this home. It's fine.

580
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,440
如果我们领养的标准
I mean, if we adopt standards based on...

581
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,530
建立在我们北方的朋友对大蟑螂的厌恶上
our northern friend's aversion to palmetto bugs...

582
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,080
那么塔拉西河南部就不会有一个孩子了
we won't have a child left south of Tallahassee.

583
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,040
再给你们最后一次机会
All right. Last chance before this starts

584
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,810
否则要花大笔律师费了
costing a lot more money.

585
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,480
法官大人 我的当事人
Your Honor, my client would need

586
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,800
需要合理探视权
reasonable access to the child.

587
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,200
法庭批准
So ordered.

588
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,410
狄本思夫人 你会去他家
Ms. Dibbons, you'll go over there

589
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,650
检查一下居住条件吗
and check out the living conditions?

590
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,720
已经计划好了 法官大人
On the books, Your Honor.

591
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,520
好了 各位 小心开车
All right, folks. Drive carefully.

592
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,240
她的律师西装很高档
Her lawyer has a nice suit.

593
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,440
放松 弗兰克 你要更关注我们能力的比较
Relax, Frank. More weight's put on the talent competition.

594
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,610
去喝杯鸡尾酒
Go have a cocktail, hmm?

595
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,290
罗伯塔 你今晚愿意照顾玛丽吗
Roberta, would you like to have Mary tonight?

596
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,120
我为什么会不愿意呢
Why wouldn't I like to have Mary tonight?

597
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,670
我就说过会发生这种事
I told you something like this would happen.

598
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,450
看看我们现在的处境
Now look where we are.

599
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,410
但愿你心里有数
And I'm supposed to believe you know what you're doing.

600
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,920
你连个白人律师都请不起
You couldn't even find a white lawyer.

601
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,760
哇 听着
Wow. Look, just...

602
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,040
- 别担心 好吗 - 少来了
- Don't worry, okay? - Don't tell me that.

603
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,120
你无论说什么
There's nothing you can say

604
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,450
都不会让我好受些
that's gonna make me feel good...

605
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,440
因为这件事上我没有发言权
because I have no say in any of this, Frank.

606
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,720
我不是亲属
I'm not a blood relative,

607
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,450
不是合法监护人 什么都不是
I'm not a legal guardian. I'm nothing!

608
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,010
只是隔壁邻居
Just the lady who lives next door,

609
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,170
我的意见无足轻重
whose opinion means nothing...

610
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,960
我的感受也无足轻重
whose feelings mean nothing.

611
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,360
还问我今晚愿不愿照顾玛丽
Would I like to have Mary tonight?

612
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,080
我每晚都愿意照顾玛丽
I'd like to have Mary every night.

613
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,390
别拦我 现在听我说
∮ Can't stop me now Hear what I say ∮

614
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,750
我要抖腿了 所以
∮ My feets gotta move, so... ∮

615
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,550
给我滚一边去
∮ Get out of my way ∮

616
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,790
我要说我的话
∮ I'm gonna have my say ∮

617
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,790
我要去每一个迪斯科舞厅
∮ I'm going to every discotheque ∮

618
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,830
我要跳舞 跳舞 跳舞 喔
∮ I'm gonna dance, dance, dance Whoo! ∮

619
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,110
一直嗨到天黑
∮ Till the break of day ∮

620
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,710
哦 丢脸 丢脸 丢脸 丢脸
∮ Oh, shame, shame, shame, shame ∮

621
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,870
嗷
∮ Oh! ∮

622
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,990
你真丢脸
∮ Shame on you ∮

623
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,470
如果你也不会跳舞
∮ If you can't dance too ∮

624
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,750
那你真丢脸 丢脸 丢脸 丢脸
∮ And I said shame, shame, shame, shame ∮

625
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,670
丢脸 丢脸 丢脸 你真丢脸
∮ Shame, shame, shame Shame on you ∮

626
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,360
嗨
Hi.

627
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
嗨
Hi.

628
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,400
我听戴维斯说到一个监护权的官司
Um, I heard Davis bragging about a custody case

629
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,920
后来我发现是谁
and then I found out whose...

630
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,610
我很内疚
I feel terrible.

631
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,760
但我想告诉你 在我们谈过之后
But I also wanted you to know that after we talked...

632
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,560
我没跟任何人说过什么
I didn't say anything to anyone.

633
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,520
我发誓
I swear.

634
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,920
我很想让你知道这一点
And it's, um, important to me that you know that.

635
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,040
我知道
I know.

636
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
好
Okay.

637
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,200
我的律师让我醉一场
My lawyer told me to get drunk.

638
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,200
喝啤酒能喝醉吗
And you're trying to do it with that?

639
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,360
好了 轮到我了
Okay. My turn.

640
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
你爱恋的第一个名人是谁
Who was your first celebrity crush?

641
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,480
应该说是
Um, I'll go with...

642
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,600
妙管家 里的莫娜
Mona from Who's the Boss?

643
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,720
哇
Oh, wow!

644
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,890
知道我说的是谁吗
You know who I'm talking about?

645
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,410
- 那个性感的奶奶 - 是的
- The sexy grandmother. - Yeah!

646
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,840
我总感觉她有个秘密
I always felt like she had a secret.

647
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,120
就是她喜欢性爱
Yeah, which is that she loved sexual intercourse.

648
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
没错
That was it.

649
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,410
她对此并不隐晦
And she wasn't secret about it.

650
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,840
所以我喜欢她
That's why I liked her.

651
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,890
知道吗 我也喜欢她
You know what? I liked her, too.

652
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,240
看到没
See?

653
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,040
好了
All right. Um...

654
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,080
最不喜欢的学生 以及原因
Least favorite student. And why.

655
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,890
不 每个学生我都喜欢
Oh, no! I love all my students.

656
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,480
我不信 完全不相信
I don't believe you. At all! Not for a second.

657
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,920
他们都很棒
No, they're all great.

658
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,800
都那么棒
They're all so great.

659
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,120
我应该喝酒了
I'm gonna go ahead and drink.

660
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,770
对 这是规矩
Let's keep this honest.

661
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,200
是男生还是女生
He? She?

662
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,200
是罗尼米德尔顿
Uh, he is Ronnie Middleton.

663
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,320
一听就不是好人
Sounds like a dick.

664
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,150
- 他只是个孩子好吗 - 对不起
- He's a little child, okay? - I'm sorry.

665
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,970
关键是他是骨子里坏
The point is that he's evil in his core.

666
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,080
而我对此无能为力
And there's nothing I can do.

667
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,730
哇
Wow.

668
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,290
你最怕什么
What's your greatest fear?

669
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,720
哇
Wow!

670
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,920
基调变了啊
That's a change of tone.

671
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,840
是的 我是个很严肃的人
Yup, I'm a really serious person.

672
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,330
好
Okay.

673
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,960
如果难以回答 你直接喝酒就是
Look, if it's too much, you can just drink your drink...

674
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,960
承认自己的害怕
and live with the fact that you're afraid.

675
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,960
我能应付
No, I can handle this. Um...

676
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,530
害怕我会毁了玛丽这一生
That I'll ruin Mary's life.

677
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,480
你非常
You're very, um...

678
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,560
令人意外 玛丽的老师
surprising, Mary's teacher.

679
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,120
非常令人意外
Very much so.

680
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,600
- 等一下 抱歉 - 怎么了
- Okay. Hold on. I'm sorry. - What?

681
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,250
就是
Just so that...

682
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,360
我觉得有句话要提前声明一下
I feel like I need to say this...

683
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,440
来消除误解
just so that there's no misconception.

684
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,680
我并没有
Oh, God. No, I didn't...

685
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,880
等一下
No, hold on!

686
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,880
我们之间是不可能的
That this can't, isn't happening.

687
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,320
我懂 我赞同
I get it. I know. I'm with you.

688
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,600
- 是吗 - 我完全赞同
- Yeah? Okay. - 100%. We're on the same page.

689
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,840
很好
Good!

690
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,800
这很好 抱歉 这很尴尬
No, that's great. I'm sorry. That's embarrassing.

691
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,530
没关系 我懂
It's okay. I get it.

692
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,520
啊
Oh!

693
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,520
- 你没事吧 - 我没事
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good.

694
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,640
好
Okay. Good.

695
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,450
你能保证玛丽不可能来吗
Can you promise that there's no way?

696
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,280
每周五晚玛丽都在罗伯塔家
Yes. Roberta has Mary

697
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,530
直到周六中午 我保证
every Saturday till noon, I promise.

698
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,480
是吗
Yeah?

699
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,280
抱歉
Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Sorry.

700
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,680
我不能这么做
I can't do this.

701
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,570
好
Okay.

702
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,760
好
Okay.

703
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,400
我理解
I understand.

704
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,000
我送你回家
I'll take you home.

705
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,920
好
Yeah.

706
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,090
抱歉 再亲一口
Sorry, just... One more time.

707
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,800
我找不到我的DVD了
I can't find my DVD.

708
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,610
就在那儿
It's right there, baby.

709
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,480
不在 不信你来找找
No, it isn't. You come and find it.

710
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,920
我忙着呢
I'm doing lady business.

711
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,450
你是最后一个看它的人
Now, you were the last person to watch it.

712
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,520
你把它放在哪儿了
What did you do with it?

713
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,360
对了
Oh...

714
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,280
天啊
Oh! Oh, my God!

715
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,560
早上好 史蒂文斯老师
Good morning, Miss Stevenson.

716
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,000
嗨
Hi.

717
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,840
听着 我…
Look, I am...

718
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,530
知道吗 我现在
Oh, you know what? I'm actually incapable...

719
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,600
没法谈这事
of having this conversation right now.

720
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,960
很好 我也正愁该说啥好
Good. 'Cause I have no idea what I was gonna say.

721
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,350
很好 很好
Great! Perfect!

722
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,560
师傅 走吧 送我去监狱
Sir, if you please. Take me to jail.

723
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,440
尴尬啊
Awkward.

724
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
玛丽
Mary...

725
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,040
停下 停下
Stop! Stop!

726
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,280
别玩积木了 听我说
Stop with the Legos! Listen.

727
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,130
我们周六上午不是有规定吗
Do we have a rule about Saturday morning?

728
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,520
什么
What?

729
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,490
我允许你周六上午进来吗
Are you allowed in this apartment this early

730
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,720
允不允许
on Saturday morning? Yes or no?

731
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,440
- 不允许 - 不允许
- No. - No!

732
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,160
我允许你… 喂

733
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,550
停下 别玩积木了
Stop! Enough with the Legos.

734
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,640
我允许你用罗伯塔的钥匙吗
Are you allowed to use Roberta's keys?

735
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,000
- 不允许 - 不允许
- No. - No!

736
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,160
喂 看着我
Hey! Look at me.

737
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,600
那你为什么来这里
Then why are you here, huh?

738
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,360
能回答我这个问题吗
Can you answer me that?

739
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,400
你违反了所有的规矩
You broke every rule!

740
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,600
你让我难堪
You just embarrassed me.

741
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,920
我们有这些规矩的
We have these rules.

742
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,120
我说过无数次了
We've gone over them a hundred times! Ahh!

743
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,680
啊
God!

744
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,410
该死的
Damn it!

745
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,680
我就不能有一点自己的生活吗
Can I just get five minutes of my own life?

746
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,280
今天发生的事完全不是你的错
Nothing that happened today was your fault.

747
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,040
我生你的气
I got mad at you...

748
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,000
我也很生自己的气
I was really mad at me.

749
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,680
生产乐高积木的商家
And the manufacturers of Legos,

750
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,120
他们都该进监狱
they should all be in prison.

751
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,120
对不起
I'm sorry.

752
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,440
你原谅我吗
Do you forgive me?

753
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,130
好 随便
Sure. Whatever.

754
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,120
喂 关上电脑 快点
Hey, close the laptop. Come on.

755
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,370
拜托 互相看着说话才算
Please. Doesn't count if it's not eye to eye.

756
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,040
拜托
Come on, please.

757
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,440
有了我 所以你没有自己的生活了吗
Do you really have no life because of me?

758
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,250
我没这么说
That's not what I said.

759
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,870
嗯
Hmm.

760
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,480
你是真心话吗
Did you mean it?

761
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,200
你上个月说过
Last month you said I was

762
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,370
我是世上最差的舅舅
the worst uncle in the world...

763
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,680
你希望我死
and you wished death upon me

764
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,040
因为我没给你买钢琴
'cause I didn't buy you a piano.

765
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,010
你是真心话吗
Did you mean that?

766
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,600
不是
No.

767
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,480
不完全是
Not entirely.

768
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,280
那就是了
There you go.

769
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,920
我们并非每句话都是真心话
We say things all the time we don't mean. So...

770
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,200
我们忘了这件事 好吗
Let's forget it, okay?

771
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
好
Okay.

772
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,360
好
Okay.

773
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,040
弗兰克
Frank?

774
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,200
什么
Yeah?

775
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,880
能给我买架钢琴吗
Can I have a piano?

776
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,080
不行
No.

777
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,720
今早真是玛丽的老师吗
Was that really Mary's teacher this morning?

778
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,360
我有本书
You know, I got a book called

779
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,090
人生基本决策
Fundamentals of Decision Making.

780
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,400
你可以借去看看
You can borrow it.

781
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,570
是什么
What is it?

782
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,360
没什么
It's nothing.

783
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,040
看来玛丽要去波士顿几天了
Looks like Mary gets to go to Boston for a couple days.

784
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,560
就两天
It's just two days.

785
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,440
你放心
Relax.

786
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,170
你觉得怎么样
So, what do you think?

787
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,400
很棒
Cool.

788
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,360
哇 你和我妈妈
Wow! You and my mom...

789
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,010
总是在一起
were always together.

790
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,360
总是
Always.

791
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,720
不 这张不要看
Oh, no, you don't want to look at that one.

792
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
这是你吗
Is that you?

793
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600
是的
Yes.

794
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,360
你当时多大
How old were you?

795
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,880
29岁
29.

796
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,320
这是在哪儿
Where is this?

797
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,560
这是剑桥大学
That's Cambridge University.

798
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,720
在英国
In England.

799
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,760
这些人是谁
Who are those people?

800
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,720
我的研究同事
My research colleagues.

801
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,720
研究什么
For what?

802
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,680
当然是数学
Mathematics, of course.

803
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,040
真的吗
Really?

804
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,520
好棒
Cool!

805
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,840
那你后来
So, then you came to work...

806
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,160
就来美国大学工作了?
at a college in America?

807
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,760
不是
No.

808
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,650
我嫁给了你外公
I married your grandfather...

809
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,160
跟他一起回到美国
and I came back to America with him.

810
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,200
然后生了孩子
And I had children.

811
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,640
哦
Oh.

812
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,920
不再研究数学了
So, no more math?

813
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,920
不早了
It's late.

814
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,840
你明天还有重要的事
You've got a big day tomorrow.

815
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,970
来 起来
Come on. Up, up, up.

816
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,490
我能弹钢琴吗
Can I play the piano?

817
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,560
不行
No, you can't.

818
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,290
- 别拖着脚了 - 可是钢琴好玩
- Now stop dragging those feet. - But, it's fun!

819
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,320
快走
Come on!

820
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,560
我做了一连串的噩梦
I have had a series of nightmares...

821
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,000
因为那件事
where I'm fired...

822
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,560
我被学校开除了
because of what happened.

823
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,210
你明白吗
You get it?

824
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,290
然后我试图解释
And then I try to rationalize...

825
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,120
那只是因为我喝醉了
that everything that happened was just all alcohol.

826
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,000
我对修理工有好感
I have an addiction to fixer guys.

827
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,960
尚克兰博士 这道题…
Dr. Shankland, this problem is...

828
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,320
我知道 原题照抄下来就是了
I know. Just copy it exactly as you see it written.

829
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,680
可这题…
But it's...

830
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,490
照抄原题 谢谢
Exactly as written. Thank you.

831
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,440
要让我看什么数学题
So, what's this problem I'm supposed to look at?

832
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,320
不知道
I don't know.

833
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,760
就像妈妈研究的那些问题吗
Is it like the problems Mom worked on?

834
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,080
你妈研究的不是一些问题
Your mother didn't work on problems.

835
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,400
她只研究了一个问题
She worked on just one problem.

836
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,320
就一个吗
Just one?

837
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,050
研究了一辈子
Her entire life?

838
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,920
大部分
Most of it.

839
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,280
看
Look.

840
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,040
这些都是千年难题
These are the Millennium Problems.

841
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,240
七个意义重大的难题
Seven great and meaningful problems.

842
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,480
有些数学家
Some mathematicians have worked

843
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,440
用了一辈子时间来证明
their entire lives to prove them.

844
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,770
这个大胡子是谁
Who's the dude with the beard?

845
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,370
他可不是普通人
That's not a dude.

846
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,760
他是格里戈里・佩雷尔曼
That's Grigori Perelman.

847
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,440
他证明了庞加莱猜想
He proved the Poincaré conjecture.

848
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,680
七个问题中唯一一个得到证明的
The only one of the seven proved.

849
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,440
这个
This...

850
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,520
这是你妈研究的问题
This is your mother's problem.

851
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,840
纳维…
Na... vi...

852
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,730
纳维尔-斯托克斯方程
Navier-Stokes.

853
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,240
没照片啊
No picture.

854
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,240
- 她没证明吗 - 没有
- She didn't solve it? - No.

855
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,730
她当时快证明出来了
She was close.

856
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,000
她本来可以获得菲尔茨奖
She would have won the Fields Medal...

857
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,560
还可能分享诺贝尔奖
and probably shared a Nobel...

858
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,080
因为在物理学上也有重要意义
considering what it would have meant for physics.

859
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,130
也许将来我的照片也能挂在上面
Maybe I'll have my picture up here someday.

860
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,000
如果你真的想
If you really desire it...

861
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,890
你可以把你的照片挂在上面 孩子
you can have your picture there, darling.

862
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,320
我可以帮你
I can help you.

863
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,240
这需要专注和刻苦 但如果你成功了
It takes focus and hard work, but if you succeed...

864
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,130
你将流芳百世
your name will live forever.

865
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,520
先别得意 西摩
Don't be smug, Seymore.

866
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,000
她看了很长时间了
Well, she's had plenty of time.

867
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,680
她昨天出了远门 没睡好
She traveled yesterday. She slept in a strange bed.

868
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,360
给她个机会
Give her a chance.

869
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,200
她6岁就看过奇默的书
At six years old, she read Zimmer.

870
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,600
厉害
Outstanding.

871
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,680
她看懂了多少
How much did she comprehend?

872
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,880
玛丽
So, Mary...

873
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,730
你在看我们的小问题
I see you're looking at our little problem.

874
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,240
小问题? 这是个大问题
Little? It's big.

875
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
是啊
Yeah.

876
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,960
你怎么突然这么生气
Why are you so mad all of a sudden?

877
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,280
我不是生气 是恼火
I'm not mad. I'm annoyed.

878
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,480
不是恼火你
Not with you, dear.

879
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,840
是恼火那个傲慢的尚克兰
With that pompous ass, Shankland.

880
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,760
我们还没进去
I knew that guy was gonna have a beard

881
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,490
就知道他是个大胡子
before we even went in there.

882
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,640
数学老师都喜欢长胡子
Math teachers like to grow beards.

883
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,160
我当初就不该答应这事
I should never have agreed to this in the first place.

884
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,680
他真的指望你
Did he really expect you

885
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,210
随随便便就能解析
to just walk in and be able to dissect...

886
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,280
某个随机的复杂难题
some random, massive problem?

887
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,480
我看也没什么可解析的
Not much to dissect, if you ask me.

888
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,040
为什么这么说
Why do you say that?

889
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,120
题错了
It was wrong.

890
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,200
什么
What?

891
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,520
首先
Well, for starters,

892
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,760
他忘了加上指数前的负号
he forgot the negative sign on the exponent.

893
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,000
后面就讲不通了
It went downhill from there.

894
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,730
这道题没法解
The problem was unsolvable.

895
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,200
也许这学校也不怎么样
Maybe this school isn't as great as you think it is.

896
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,930
玛丽 既然你知道题是错的
Mary, you knew the problem was incorrect.

897
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,160
怎么不早说呢
Why didn't you say anything?

898
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,200
弗兰克说我不要去指出长辈的错误
Frank says I'm not supposed to correct older people.

899
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,960
没人喜欢自作聪明的人
Nobody likes a smart-ass.

900
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,040
我带了好多好东西
I'm loaded with swag!

901
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,560
要进屋坐吗
Wanna come inside?

902
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,520
猫
Cat.

903
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,680
弗兰克 我觉得这样很傻
Frank, I think this is stupid.

904
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,880
我们给伊芙琳打电话
Why don't we just call Evelyn

905
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,320
说我不愿意不就成了吗
and tell her I don't wanna do this?

906
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,600
因为我说过
Because like I told you,

907
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,240
伊芙琳说的不算 这是法庭判的
Evelyn didn't order this. The court did.

908
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,800
那么我们该怎么办
So again, what are we gonna do?

909
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,960
说实话
Tell the truth.

910
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,040
没错
Exactly.

911
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,450
我们越早回答这些问题
Sooner we answer these questions,

912
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,560
就能越早回家
sooner we get to go home.

913
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,920
要配合 好吗
So, no attitude, okay?

914
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,680
好
Okay.

915
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,320
弗兰克
Frank?

916
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,520
玛丽
Mary.

917
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,410
我喜欢伊芙琳
I like Evelyn.

918
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,160
她长得像我妈妈
She looks like my mom.

919
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,810
而且她还有钢琴
And she has a piano.

920
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,640
可我不想跟她一起住
But I don't wanna live with her.

921
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,000
她很专横
She's bossy.

922
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,360
这话我听过
I've heard that.

923
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,050
喂
Hey.

924
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,730
你放心 你哪儿都不会去
Don't worry. You're not going anywhere.

925
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
你保证?
Promise?

926
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,290
我保证
I promise.

927
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,520
嗨 玛丽 我叫帕特戈尔丁
Hi, Mary. I'm Pat Golding,

928
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,000
你叫我帕特就行
but you can call me Pat if you like.

929
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,730
知道了
Got it.

930
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,640
你知道你为什么来吗
Do you know why you're here?

931
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,120
有人说过是为了什么事吗
I mean has anyone told you what this is about?

932
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,840
我外婆希望我跟她一起住
My grandmother wants me to live with her

933
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,160
而我想跟弗兰克一起住
and I wanna stay with Frank.

934
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,240
很好
That's correct.

935
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,600
我知道这可能挺可怕的
I'm sure this can all be very scary stuff.

936
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,520
你担心过吗
Does any of it worry you?

937
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,650
不担心 弗兰克说我哪儿也不去
Nope. Frank says I'm not goin' anywhere.

938
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,360
你舅舅说你哪儿都不去
Your uncle told you you're not going anywhere?

939
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,240
15分钟之前说的
Just 15 minutes ago.

940
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,360
我们谈完了吗
So, we done here?

941
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,370
还没有
Not quite yet.

942
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,280
除了弗兰克和弗雷德 我最好的朋友就是罗伯塔
My best friend other than Frank and Fred is Roberta...

943
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,800
她住在我家附近
who lives a couple houses away.

944
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,080
是吗 她是什么样的人
Really? What's she like?

945
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,400
她和善 风趣 我喜欢她
She's nice and funny. And I love her.

946
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,960
那挺好
That's nice.

947
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,160
罗伯塔是你唯一的同龄朋友吗
Is Roberta your only friend your age?

948
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,920
罗伯塔跟我不同龄 她大概40 50
Roberta's not my age. She's like 40, 50...

949
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,730
30多岁的样子
30-something.

950
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,680
罗伯塔是个成年人?
Roberta's a grown woman?

951
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,040
我的同龄人都很无趣
People my age are boring.

952
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,880
罗伯塔很棒
Roberta's cool.

953
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,880
好
Okay.

954
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,200
我不看电视
I don't watch TV.

955
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,520
但我喜欢海绵宝宝
But I got hooked on SpongeBob.

956
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,640
主要是因为罗伯塔喜欢
Mostly because Roberta loves it.

957
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,600
对了 我们周六晚上会看UFC
Oh. And on Saturday nights, we watch the UFC.

958
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,760
UFC? 是不是…
The UFC? Is that...

959
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,080
是终极格斗吗
Is that Ultimate Fighting?

960
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,200
每周六都看
Every Saturday.

961
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,640
你和你舅看终极格斗?
You and your uncle watch Ultimate Fighting?

962
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,080
不只是看
Well, you don't just watch it.

963
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,850
弗兰克把声音调低
Frank turns the sound down

964
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,640
我们俩来配音
and we do the grunting and voices.

965
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,510
有时我真的用力打弗兰克
Sometimes I attack Frank for real.

966
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,680
对我来说很开心
Which is really fun for me.

967
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,800
如果你们了解弗兰克
I think if you guys knew Frank,

968
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,370
就会让我们住在一起了
you'd leave us alone.

969
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,920
他虽然有时很烦人
He can be pretty annoying...

970
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,770
但他是个好人
but he's a good person.

971
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,080
应该是吧
I think.

972
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,610
为什么这么说
Why do you say that?

973
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,440
我聪明之前他就喜欢我
He wanted me before I was smart.

974
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,240
波拉德先生
Mr. Pollard, are you...

975
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,130
你是玛丽阿德勒的生父吗
the natural father of Mary Adler?

976
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,770
是的
Yes, I am.

977
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,490
你何以确定
And how can you be certain of this?

978
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,080
我一直知道 后来你们让我
Well, I always knew, but then you had me...

979
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,730
做了DNA测试
take a DNA test.

980
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,480
我想提供测试结果
I would offer the test results

981
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,680
证明波拉德先生
as presumptive evidence that Mr. Pollard...

982
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,880
是这孩子的生父和自然监护人
is the father and natural guardian of the minor.

983
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,530
同时作为证言
As well as an affidavit...

984
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,520
波拉德先生提出
from Mr. Pollard nominating...

985
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,680
让孩子的外婆阿德勒夫人
Mrs. Adler, the maternal grandmother,

986
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,600
为孩子的法定监护人
as the legal guardian of the minor.

987
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,440
没有反对
No objections.

988
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,280
波拉德先生
Mr. Pollard...

989
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,920
阿德勒夫人给过你任何金钱
has Mrs. Adler offered you any monetary reward...

990
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,560
或职位来请你出庭吗
or employment for coming forward today?

991
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,560
没有 我自己有工作
No, sir. I have a job of my own.

992
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,760
谢谢
Thank you.

993
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,520
没别的问题了 法官大人
No further questions, Your Honor.

994
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,840
波拉德先生
Mr. Pollard...

995
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,360
你最后一次见到玛丽是什么时候
when was the last time you saw Mary?

996
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,120
呃 我从未见过她
Uh... I've never seen her.

997
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,480
为什么
Oh, why not?

998
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,440
当我听说黛安…
By the time I heard about Diane...

999
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,080
去世时
passing...

1000
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,040
孩子已经不在了
the baby was gone already.

1001
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,400
你试图找过她吗
Well, did you try and find her?

1002
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,080
尽力找了
Best I could.

1003
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,200
我总不能找遍全国吧
I couldn't just go and search the entire country.

1004
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,400
你上班用电脑吗
Do you use a computer at work?

1005
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,480
当然
Sure.

1006
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,400
那你帮我个忙
You know what? Help me out.

1007
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,920
搜索一下玛丽阿德勒
Here, let's google "Mary Adler"

1008
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,360
看看能搜到什么
and, uh, see what we find.

1009
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,130
这样吧
You know what?

1010
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,880
最好把她的中间名也加进去
Uh, you better add her middle name.

1011
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,160
能缩小搜索范围
It'll narrow it down.

1012
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,080
是艾琳
Eileen.

1013

1017
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,760
是一篇报纸文章 题为
It's a newspaper article called

1018
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,040
非典型两岁儿童
"Not So Terrible Twos."

1019
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,760
其中一个就是玛丽艾琳阿德勒
And one of them is Mary Eileen Adler.

1020
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,600
跟你女儿同名
Same name as your daughter.

1021
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,450
和你女儿同一天生日
Born on the same day as your daughter.

1022
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,600
还有照片
With a photograph.

1023
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,410
当然你不可能认得出来
Um, in your defense, you'd never recognize it...

1024
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,130
- 法官大人 这… - 法官大人
- Your Honor, this is... - Your Honor...

1025
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,320
很明显的一点是
if there's one thing here that's sadly obvious...

1026
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,200
波拉德先生从来不是
it's that Mr. Pollard has never been

1027
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,930
孩子的真正监护人
a genuine guardian of the minor...

1028
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,960
他对阿德勒夫人的提名
and his nomination of Mrs. Adler

1029
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,610
也是没有诚意的
is no less disingenuous.

1030
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,560
佛罗里达州尊重
While the State of Florida gives deference

1031
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,010
孩子父母的提名
to nomination by a natural parent...

1032
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,930
但这次我倾向于支持
I'm inclined to side with Mr. Cullen's laptop...

1033
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,200
卡伦先生的笔记本电脑
at this time.

1034
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,480
谢谢你 法官大人
Thank you, Your Honor.

1035
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,040
别得意
Don't gloat.

1036
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,880
想都不敢想
Wouldn't dream of it.

1037
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,080
送你去车上
Walk you to your car?

1038
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,970
刚才忙着打官司 我不好意思问
We've been so preoccupied, I'm almost ashamed to ask.

1039
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,000
沃尔特还好吗
How's Walter?

1040
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,120
说了恐怕你也不信
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

1041
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,200
怎么了
Why?

1042
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,000
你的继父在蒙大拿
Well, your stepfather is in Montana.

1043
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,960
他买了个农场
He bought a ranch.

1044
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,040
扯淡
Bullshit.

1045
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,930
可不是嘛 他认为只要远离
Exactly. A man whose idea of roughing it...

1046
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,960
丽思卡尔顿酒店的制冰机 那就是返璞归真
is being too far from the ice machine at the Ritz-Carlton...

1047
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,320
他现在拥有着1000英亩的草地和牛粪
now owns a 1,000 acres of grass and dung.

1048
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,080

1051
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,920
他有顶牛仔帽和一双牛仔靴
He has a cowboy hat and cowboy boots...

1052
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,360
和一匹不会马术的马
and a horse that doesn't know dressage.

1053
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,280
他为什么这么做呢
Is there some logical reason for this?

1054
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,040
可能是中年危机吧
Midlife crisis, apparently.

1055
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,640
他都70岁了
He's 70.

1056
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,960
可不是嘛
I know.

1057
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,160
肯定是延迟了吧
Must have been on time delay or something.

1058
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,040
我应该高兴才是
I guess I should be happy

1059
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,520
毕竟他不是有了小三
it wasn't a 25-year-old cocktail waitress.

1060
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,680
但话说回来
But then again,

1061
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,000
如果是婚外情 我三言两语就能向朋友解释清
an affair you can explain to friends in a minute.

1062
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,600
但这事 要花很长时间才能让别人听明白
For this, you put on a pot of coffee.

1063
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,640
他现在去体验荒野了
And he's out there right now?

1064
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,840
是的
Yessiree!

马褡裢上装满了立普妥

开枪打了利宝保险的人
The man who shot Liberty Mutual.

1070
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,880
我一直都这么称呼他
That's what I've been calling him.

1071
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,570
这事确实很扯淡
That's really, really funny.

1072
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,000
送她去机场
Take her to the airport.

1073
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,600
回家去吧 伊芙琳
Go home, Evelyn.

1074
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,080
或者去蒙大拿放牛
Or Montana. Rustle some cattle.

1075
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
你知道
You know...

1076
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,320
我完全不想伤害你
I have no desire to hurt you.

1077
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,440
我不喜欢跟你发生冲突
I hate it that we're at odds.

1078
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,920
我们老是在冲突
We're always at odds.

1079
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,240
是的
Yes.

1080
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,490
酒店
Hotel.

1081
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,240
玛丽 孩子 拜托
Mary, baby, come on now.

1082
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,320
别哭了
Stop this now.

1083
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,800
不
No.

1084
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,400
- 出来吧 - 不
- Come on out, honey. - No.

1085
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,370
你干嘛跟她说她爸爸也出庭了
Why did you have to tell her that deadbeat was testifying?

1086
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,480
因为这是事实
Because it's the truth.

1087
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,840
如果我不说 伊芙琳也会说的
And if I didn't, Evelyn would've.

1088
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,960
如果我是父亲 有个女儿
If I was the dad of a little girl

1089
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,560
从未见过
and I never saw her...

1090
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,960
而且住在同一个城市
and I was in the same town...

1091
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,450
我肯定会去看她
I would visit her.

1092
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,090
这下你满意了
Well, I hope you're happy.

1093
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,810
他根本不需要问路
He didn't even need directions.

1094
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,720
跟着你来就是了
He could've followed you here.

1095
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,560
这就是所说的渣男人
Speaking of men who aren't worth a damn.

1096
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,240
他甚至不想看到我的样子
Doesn't even wanna see what I look like.

1097
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,480
好了
All right.

1098
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,440
喂 你穿上鞋 我们开车出去一下
Hey, put your shoes on. We're going for a ride.

1099
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,560
你也是
You too.

1100
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,640
开车出去
A ride?

1101
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,680
我们来这里干什么
What are we doing here?

1102
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,520
等着
Waiting.

1103
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,760
这是废话
We can see that.

1104
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,200
为什么等
Why?

1105
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,560
因为我让你们等着
Because I said so.

1106
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,720
我们要等多久
How long do we have to stay here?

1107
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,680
需要多久就多久
As long as it takes.

1108
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,960
说话小点声 这里是医院
And keep your voice down. It's a hospital.

1109
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,240
- 吃的来了 - 是啊 吃的来了
- Food's here. - Yeah, food's here.

1110
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,360
是个男孩
It's a boy.

1111
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,360
好样的
Way to go!

1112
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,160
你出生时就是这个情景
That's exactly how it was when you were born.

1113
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,080
这么开心吗
This happy?

1114
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,770
这么开心
This happy.

1115
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,160
当时是谁出来跟大家说的
Who came out and told everybody?

1116
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,090
是我
I did.

1117
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,040
我们再等着看一个吧
Can we stay for another?

1118
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,290
阿德勒夫人 在你今天之前的证词中
Mrs. Adler, in your earlier testimony, here today...

1119
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,600
你把自己的儿子说的很不堪
you've painted a pretty dim picture of your own son.

1120
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:33,800
不是吗
Don't you think?

1121
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,530
我是宣过誓的
I'm under oath.

1122
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,440
我也不想说这些话
I take no pleasure in it.

1123
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,850
那么你儿子的人生失败
So, your son's a failure in life,

1124
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,080
你女儿自杀了
your daughter took her life.

1125
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,240
你算是失败两次了
You know, you're oh for two.

1126
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,840
- 我反对 - 撤回
- Objection! - Withdrawn.

1127
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,650
如果我有第三个孩子 我会进名人堂了
If I go one for three, I'm in the Hall of Fame.

1128
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,760
你了解棒球
You know baseball.

1129
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,920
芬威球场
Fenway Park.

1130
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,600
我很想有时间去那里看看
You know, I'd like to go there some time.

1131
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,120
你一年带着黛安
How often in a year

1132
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,850
去看几次棒球比赛
did you take Diane to a baseball game?

1133
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,650
黛安对体育不感兴趣
Diane wasn't interested in sports.

1134
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,920
她从不想去看比赛 一次也没有
She never wanted to go to a game? Ever?

1135
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,650
我不记得她要求过
I don't recall her ever asking.

1136
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,880
我有些好奇 芬威球场的票不好买
Just out of curiosity, Fenway, that's a tough ticket.

1137
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,080
你的票是怎么买到的
Where do you get yours?

1138
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,610
我丈夫有季票
My husband has season tickets.

1139
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,880
他有季票多长时间
And how long has he had them?

1140
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,480
30年
30 years.

1141
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,680
但我跟他结婚20年
But I've only been married to him for 20.

1142
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,920
黛安一场比赛都没去看过
And Diane never went to one game?

1143
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,880
黛安是穿什么颜色的裙子参加毕业舞会的
What color was the dress Diane wore to prom?

1144
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,650
黛安没参加毕业舞会
Diane didn't attend a prom

1145
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,770
因为她没上高中
because she didn't go to a high school.

1146
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,800
没参加毕业舞会
No prom.

1147
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,000
她喜欢什么体育运动
What sports did she play?

1148
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,320
我刚才说了
As I told you earlier,

1149
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,080
她对体育不感兴趣
she wasn't interested in sports.

1150
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,370
她去过夏令营吗
Did she go to camp during the summer?

1151
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,440
没有
No.

1152
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,680
- 社区游泳池呢 - 我家有游泳池
- Community swimming pool? - We had our own pool.

1153
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,130
- 女童子军呢 - 没有
- Girl Scouts? - No.

1154
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,840
那么她这些年来都干什么
Then what did she do with all that time?

1155
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,480
她喜欢数学 那是她的爱好
She loved mathematics. It was her passion.

1156
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,080
她喜欢数学胜过一切
She preferred it to all other things.

1157
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,480
一切
All other?

1158
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,600
阿德勒夫人 保罗里瓦是谁
Mrs. Adler, who's Paul Riva?

1159
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,930
他是邻居家的男孩
He was a boy from the neighborhood.

1160
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,480
拜托 他可远不只是
Oh, come on. He was much more than...

1161
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,290
邻居家的男孩
just a boy from the neighborhood.

1162
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,010
保罗是黛安的初恋
Paul was Diane's first love...

1163
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,200
对吗
wasn't he?

1164
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,360
我不这么看 不是
I wouldn't characterize it that way. No.

1165
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,360
黛安是怎么看的
And how would Diane characterize it?

1166
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,560
黛安当时才17岁
Diane was 17 years old at the time.

1167
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,480
对爱情一无所知
She didn't know anything about love.

1168
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,320
阿德勒夫人
Mrs. Adler...

1169
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,400
在1998年1月
in January of 1998...

1170
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,570
黛安是不是和年轻的里瓦先生私奔了
didn't Diane and young Mr. Riva run away together?

1171
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,720
他强迫她的
He coerced her.

1172
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,320
- 他们去了哪里 - 佛蒙特
- And where did they go? - Vermont.

1173
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,890
你报警了 是不是
And you called the police, didn't you?

1174
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,410
- 因为他绑架了她 - 是的
- Because he kidnapped her? - Yes. Yes.

1175
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,920
警方在哪里找到了里瓦先生和黛安
And where did the police find young Mr. Riva and Diane?

1176
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,440
我说过了 是在佛蒙特
I told you. Vermont.

1177
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,360
是佛蒙特的斯托吧
Stowe, Vermont. Wasn't it?

1178
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,520
一个旅游小镇
A resort town.

1179
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,680
斯托山
Stowe Mountain.

1180
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,920
他带她去滑雪
He took her skiing.

1181
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,810
绑架者一般不会
You see, kidnappers don't usually

1182
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,250
带被绑架人去滑雪
take their victims skiing.

1183
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,240
但保罗是这么做的
But this is what Paul did...

1184
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,080
因为他和黛安在相爱
because he and Diane were in love.

1185
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,160
不
No.

1186
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,480
他们回来后
And when they returned,

1187
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,480
你指控他绑架
you pressed kidnapping charges.

1188
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,800
你起诉了他父母
You filed a lawsuit against his parents...

1189
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,000
直到保罗不再跟黛安打电话了
until Paul stopped calling Diane.

1190
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,490
- 是不是 - 是的
- Didn't you? - Yes.

1191
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,280
后来黛安跟保罗就再也没有来往了
And Diane never heard from or saw Paul Riva again.

1192
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,360
是不是
Did she?

1193
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,200
据我所知没有
Not to my knowledge.

1194
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,090
她对此反应如何
And how did she take it?

1195
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,360
她消沉了一段时间
She was upset for a while.

1196
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,680
心不在焉
She lost focus.

1197
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,600
心不在焉
She lost focus.

1198
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,330
阿德勒夫人 1999年3月
Mrs. Adler, in March of 1999...

1199
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,130
黛安是不是试图自杀过
didn't Diane Adler attempt to take her own life?

1200
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,240
那次是小事 没什么要紧的
This episode was minor. It was nothing.

1201
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,800
我手上拿着医院的记录
I have the hospital report in my hand.

1202
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,330
那没什么要紧的
It was nothing.

1203
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,680
黛安跟普通人不一样
Diane was not like regular people.

1204
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,080
她是特殊的人
She was extraordinary.

1205
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,570
而特殊的人
And extraordinary people

1206
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,240
会有一些特别的障碍和需求
come with singular issues and needs.

1207
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,520
你根本不知道她的才能有多强
You have no idea the capability she possessed.

1208
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,400
亿里挑一的人才
One in a billion.

1209
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,360
难道你会说 不要这些才能了
And you would say, "Fine, let's throw that away...

1210
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:48,610
任由为我家修剪草坪的男孩勾引她吧
"so the boy who cuts our yard can make a sexual conquest."

1211
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,480
在你做决定之前
Maybe before you make that decision,

1212
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,080
站在我的角度想想
you stand in my shoes.

1213
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,680
我的责任远不只是
I had responsibilities which went beyond

1214
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,170
一个母亲的责任
the mother-daughter relationship.

1215
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,360
为人类带来进步的
The greatest discoveries

1216
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,280
那些最伟大的发现
which have improved life on this planet...

1217
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,680
都是出自极为罕见的人才
have come from minds rarer than radium.

1218
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,490
没有他们的话 人类依然会茹毛饮血
Without them, we'd still be crawling in mud.

1219
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,210
告诉你 律师
And for your information, counselor...

1220
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,170
在这男孩的事结束一年之后
a year after this incident with this boy...

1221
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,560
黛安感谢了我对她的干涉
Diane thanked me for my intervention.

1222
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,480
她明白她犯了个错误 并感谢了我
She realized she'd made a mistake and she thanked me.

1223
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,480
黛安明白她有责任
You see, Diane understood she was accountable

1224
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:20,760
去发挥自己的天赋
for the gift she'd been given.

1225
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,120
她也没有逃避
And she didn't shy from it.

1226
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,200
如果她今天能在法庭上
And I think, if she were here today, Mr. Attorney...

1227
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,840
她会驳斥你毫无根据的影射
she would refute your baseless insinuations...

1228
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,680
说她放弃远大的前程
that she would give up her brilliant future

1229
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,840
选择自杀
and take her own life...

1230
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,600
只因为她妈妈没给她买一辆红色童车
just because Mommy didn't get her a little red wagon.

1231
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,650
我没问题了
No more questions.

1232
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,840
阿德勒先生
Mr. Adler...

1233
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,720
你目前在哪里工作
where are you currently employed?

1234
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,880
我修船
I repair boats.

1235
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,760
是吗 在哪个船坞
Oh, really? At which marina?

1236
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,800
不是船坞 我是打零工的
I don't work at a marina. I freelance.

1237
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,960
那么你没有医疗保险
So, safe to say, no health insurance.

1238
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,160
没有
No.

1239
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,370
你姐姐自杀之前大约一周
About a week before your sister took her life...

1240
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,000
你是做什么职业的
what were you doing for a living then?

1241
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,760
我是老师
I was a teacher.

1242
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,570
这话太谦虚了吧
You're being modest, aren't you?

1243
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,560
你当时是波士顿大学的教授
You were a professor at Boston University...

1244
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,800
是吗
isn't that right?

1245
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,840
是的 是助理教授
Yes, well, Assistant Professor.

1246
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,410
你教什么
And what'd you teach?

1247
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,480
哲学
Philosophy.

1248
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,480
事实和逻辑 这方面内容的吧
Truth and logic. That sort of thing.

1249
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,680
你的律师说你收养玛丽
Your attorney said that the primary reason...

1250
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,320
主要原因是你姐姐
that you took Mary is because it was what your sister...

1251
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,840
希望你这么做 这是事实吗
would have wanted you to do. Is that the truth?

1252
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
是的
Yes.

1253
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,200
那么黛安以前来过Pinellas县
So Diane had visited Pinellas County before?

1254
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,960
没有
No.

1255
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,170
她说过希望女儿
Indicated she wanted her daughter

1256
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,360
搬到这里吗
uprooted and moved here?

1257
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,200
- 没有 - 没有
- No. - No.

1258
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,680
那么是你决定把玛丽带到这里 是不是
So, you decided to bring Mary here, didn't you?

1259
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,400
黛安对你在波士顿大学的
Did Diane have a problem

1260
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,160
医疗保险有异议吗
with your health plan at Boston University?

1261
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,240
据我所知没有
Not to my knowledge.

1262
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,410
你觉得她会希望女儿
Do you think she would want her daughter

1263
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,570
有医疗保险吗
to have access to healthcare?

1264
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,480
当然
Of course.

1265
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,240
那么玛丽生病的时候你怎么办
So what do you do, when little Mary gets sick?

1266
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,840
去给医生修船吗
You repair a doctor's boat?

1267
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,800
- 我反对 - 反对有效
- Objection. - Sustained.

1268
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,840
玛丽被认为是
Mary has been identified...

1269
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,200
数学天才
as a math prodigy.

1270
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,560
但在你的监护下 她接受的正规数学教育
But her formal math education under your care...

1271
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,920
只是一年级水平 对吗
she's learning at the first grade level, isn't she?

1272
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,040
是的
Yes.

1273
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,640
而你拒绝了橡树学校的奖学金
And you turned down a scholarship at the Oaks...

1274
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,040
一所专门教育天才儿童的学校
a school specializing in the education of gifted children?

1275
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,120
是的
Yes.

1276
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,240
黛安对此会同意吗
And Diane, she'd be fine with that?

1277
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:42,240
我没法说
I couldn't say.

1278
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,170
阿德勒夫人给玛丽电脑前
Prior to Mrs. Adler giving her one,

1279
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,280
她自己有电脑吗
did Mary have a computer?

1280
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,400
她用我的电脑
She used mine.

1281
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,640
阿德勒先生 黛安的女儿有自己的卧室吗
Mr. Adler, does Diane's daughter have her own bedroom?

1282
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,760
没有
No.

1283
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,530
她睡的床是不是你
Does she sleep in a bed that you bought...

1284
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,000
- 从二手店买的 - 是的
- in a secondhand shop? - Yes.

1285
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,680
那么事实就是 阿德勒先生
So, the truth is, Mr. Adler,

1286
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,330
你搬到这里不是因为
that you didn't come down here

1287
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,970
你姐姐希望你搬来
because your sister wanted you to...

1288
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,250
也不是因为
and you certainly didn't come here

1289
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,440
这是为了玛丽着想
because it was good for Mary.

1290
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,280
不 是出于私人感情
No, it was personal.

1291
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,120
黛安是明星 而你不是
Diane was a star. You weren't.

1292
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,960
黛安受人关注 而你没有
Diane got the attention. You didn't.

1293
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,530
这些年来 你变得易怒
And over the years, you got angry.

1294
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,720
后来有了玛丽
And here comes Mary.

1295
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,840
真是报复的好机会
What a great way to get even.

1296
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,600
你把那小女孩
You've uprooted that little girl

1297
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,360
带到这里 只有一个原因
and brought her here for one reason only.

1298
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,400
是为了伤害你母亲
To do harm to your mother.

1299
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:18,720
你把姐姐的死怪在她身上
You blamed her for your sister.

1300
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,840
我没有
No, I don't.

1301
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,570
玛丽只是你用来报复的工具 是吗
And Mary to you is just a pawn in all this. Isn't she?

1302
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,640
黛安希望玛丽
Diane wanted Mary...

1303
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,130
做个普通孩子
to be a kid.

1304
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,600
希望她能有完整的人生
She wanted her to have a life.

1305
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,880
希望她能有朋友
She wanted her to have friends...

1306
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,280
能玩
and to play...

1307
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,600
能幸福
and to be happy.

1308
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,920
你知道平淡的生活
Do you realize the consequences

1309
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
会让天才儿童怎么样吗
of boredom for a gifted child, Mr. Adler?

1310
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,280
他们会变得易怒 郁闷
They become resentful and sullen.

1311
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,480
玛丽不是易怒的孩子
Mary's not an angry kid.

1312
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,640
是吗
Really?

1313
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,720
她没在校车上打过一个孩子吗
Did she not attack a child on the school bus?

1314
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,520
一个12岁的孩子
A 12-year-old tripped

1315
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,010
绊倒了一个7岁孩子 她站出来维护他
a 7- year- old and she came to his defense.

1316
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,960
- 她是不是把那男孩鼻子打破了 - 是的
- Did she break the boy's nose? - Yes.

1317
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,120
去年10月16日 你是不是因为伤人被捕了
On October 16th of last year were you arrested for assault?

1318
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,520
天啊
Oh, my God.

1319
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,840
你必须回答问题 阿德勒先生
NICHOLS: You have to answer the question, Mr. Adler.

1320
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,120
一个喝醉的笨蛋打我 我是自卫
A drunk idiot attacked me and I defended myself.

1321
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,370
这跟黛安有什么关系
What does that have to do with anything?

1322
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,680
你是不是被拘留了一晚
Did you spend the night in jail?

1323
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,520
是的
Yeah.

1324
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,640
你真是不自量力
You are in way over your head here.

1325
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,240
你剥夺了她的未来
You're depriving that girl.

1326
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,690
拿她的前程做赌注
You're gambling with her future...

1327
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,770
现在你有了机会
and now you're being presented with an opportunity...

1328
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,970
能好好待她
to do right by her. Jump at it.

1329
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,330
律师对我的当事人有问题吗
Does counsel have a question for my client?

1330
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,770
做出明智的选择 阿德勒先生
Take the high road, Mr. Adler...

1331
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,010
趁她还能挽救
before she is irreparably damaged.

1332
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,130
律师对我的当事人
Does counsel have a question...

1333
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,170
- 到底有没有问题 - 有 先生
- for my client or not? - Yes, sir.

1334
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,850
我确实有个问题
I do have the question.

1335
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,000
告诉我们 你继续做监护人
Tell us, is your continued guardianship...

1336
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,320
真的是对她最好的吗
really in the best interest of this little girl?

1337
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,360
是的
Yes.

1338
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,040
是的
Yes, it is.

1339
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,560
我没别的问题了
I have no further questions.

1340
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,410
研发部
Research and Development...

1341
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,040
发明了一种全新的弗雷德加油
has come up with a brand new Fred cheer.

1342
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,170
弗雷德问过我会不会告诉你
Fred personally asked me if I would tell you it.

1343
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,200
让我听听
Let's hear it.

1344
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,560
加油 为我加油 弗雷德
S-O-C-K I-T Sock it to me, Freddy...

1345
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,040
加油
Sock it.

1346
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,860
加油
Sock it.

1347
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,170
告诉研发部 他们成功了
Tell R and D, they got a winner.

1348
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,480
我也是这么说的
That's exactly what I said.

1349
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:24,120
加油 为我加油 弗雷德
S-O-C-K I-T Sock it to me, Freddy

1350
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,640
他们想达成协议
They wanna cut a deal.

1351
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,800
海史密斯今天一早给我打了电话
Highsmith called me first thing this morning.

1352
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,560
他为什么要这样 我不明白
Why would he do that? I don't understand.

1353
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,960
现在正在…
In the middle of...

1354
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,560
听着 听我说
Just listen. Listen to me, man.

1355
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,600
把玛丽送到一个寄养家庭
Mary would be put in a fostering situation.

1356
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,880
不行
No.

1357
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,250
- 拜托 弗兰克 - 不行
- Come on, Frank. - Cullen, I told you no.

1358
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,640
这不是法庭指定的
It wouldn't be a court- appointed

1359
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,040
寄养家庭 弗兰克
foster family, Frank.

1360
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,610
- 别说了 - 我们可以选择
- Hey! Drop it! - We could cherry-pick...

1361
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:52,760
最好的寄养家庭
from the cream of the crop.

1362
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,490
双方都同意的家庭
Mutually approved.

1363
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,650
听我说完
Just hear me out.

1364
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,760
必须在坦帕
Tampa.

1365
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,880
我坚持这一点 他们也同意了
I insisted, and they agreed.

1366
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,640
距离你家不能超过半小时车程
No more than a half an hour from your front door.

1367
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,720
她要去橡树学校上学
Now, she would attend the Oaks.

1368
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,530
那是所好学校
It's a great school.

1369
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,320
外婆有探视权
And visiting rights for the grandmother...

1370
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,880
但她总能得到探视权的
but she was gonna get that anyway.

1371
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,040
等她满12岁之后
Right? And on her 12th birthday, Frank,

1372
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,400
她可以重回法庭
she can go back into court...

1373
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,640
- 不行 - 然后决定
- No. - and decide then...

1374
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,890
她想跟谁住在一起
where she wants to live and with who.

1375
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,800
我不明白
I don't understand this.

1376
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,210
你本该站在我这一边的
I thought you were supposed to be on my team.

1377
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,410
为什么跟我谈这个协议
Why are you bringing me this deal?

1378
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,440
这是法律规定我必须做的
Other than I'm required to by law?

1379
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,010
你觉得这协议有利?
You like this deal?

1380
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,160
太有利了
I love this deal.

1381
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,600
他们担心会输掉官司
They think they're gonna lose.

1382
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,600
是的
Yeah.

1383
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,880
他们是的
They do.

1384
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,810
你也担心我们会输
You think we're gonna lose.

1385
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,160
是的
Yes.

1386
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,040
我是的 弗兰克
I do, Frank.

1387
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,330
我要去哄孩子睡觉了
I gotta go put my kids to bed.

1388
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,200
你让我干什么我就干什么
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

1389
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,400
但如果这案子让尼克尔斯法官来判决的话
But if we leave this up to that judge, Nichols...

1390
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,560
他很传统 弗兰克
he's old school, Frank.

1391
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,840
他喜欢你母亲的为人吗 不
Does he like your mother? No.

1392
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,330
但他喜欢她的收入吗
Does he like her income?

1393
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,520
喜欢她的医疗保险吗 喜欢她的住宅吗
Does he like her health plan? Does he like her home?

1394
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,640
那是肯定的
You better believe it.

1395
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,520
我去过他的法庭
I've been in his courtroom.

1396
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,250
很多次了
A hundred times.

1397
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,200
如果他要二选一的话
And if it's a coin toss...

1398
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,520
看着我
Look at me.

1399
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,240
如果他要二选一的话
If it's a coin toss...

1400
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,320
这老头会倾向于钱
that old boy is going to side with the money.

1401
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,160
就当帮我个忙 弗兰克
So, do me a favor, Frank.

1402
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:48,050
去寄养家庭看看 看看感觉如何
Just meet the family. See how it feels.

1403
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,560
我只有这个要求
It's all I ask.

1404
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,940
飞吧 美丽的小鸟
∮ Fly away, little pretty bird ∮

1405
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,550
快快飞走吧
∮ Fly, fly away... ∮

1406
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,040
泳池 佛罗里达
Pool. Florida.

1407
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,360
码头在海岸之间
That dock is on the Intercoastal.

1408
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,280
我觉得这很明显
Which I guess is obvious...

1409
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,440
因为我们就住在海岸之间
since we're on the Intercoastal.

1410
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,280
这是新添的书桌 让她可以做作业
Added this desk, so she could do her homework.

1411
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,960
是啊
Yeah.

1412
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,440
这里将是她的卧室
And this would be her room.

1413
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:44,380
在你眼中我看到希望
∮ I see in your eyes a promise ∮

1414
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,120
我一直对你说这房子的好处
So, while I'm trying to sell you on the house...

1415
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,960
说我们的好处
and us...

1416
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,690
只为了让你知道
I just don't want you to think

1417
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,480
我们完全理解
that we're completely insensitive...

1418
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,320
你的感受
to what you're feeling.

1419
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,560
你们家里养猫没问题吧
You guys gonna be okay with a cat?

1420
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,200
没问题
Absolutely.

1421
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,950
爱那温情之火温暖了
∮ Love's own tender flames ∮

1422
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,470
此刻的相逢
∮ Warm this meeting ∮

1423
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,990
你将哼起那首轻柔的情歌
∮ And love's tender song you will sing ∮

1424
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,270
可我美丽的鸟儿
∮ But fly away... ∮

1425
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,680
我最近考虑了很多 妥协 这个词
I've been thinking a lot about the word "compromise."

1426
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,320
一方面 她能上好学校
On one hand, good challenging school...

1427
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:42,810
但另一方面
on the other...

1428
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,640
寄养父母
foster people.

1429
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,400
他们跟她一起看连续剧
They can watch sitcoms with her.

1430
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,480
带她去橄榄花园
Take her to Olive Garden.

1431
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,290
教她 不管不顾 这个词
Teach her to say "irregardless."

1432
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,160
我想唯一的好处是
The only saving grace, I suppose,

1433
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,280
她这样总比以前强
is she's better off than she was.

1434
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,360
那么
Well...

1435
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,400
再见 弗兰克
Goodbye, Frank.

1436
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,400
喂
Hey...

1437
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,130
别难过
come on.

1438
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,970
我开车只需25分钟
I'm only 25 minutes away.

1439
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,160
别把我留在这里
Please don't leave me here.

1440
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,730
- 求你了 - 不
- Please. - No.

1441
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,320
你要去
Look, you're going to

1442
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,810
一所新学校 是好学校
a brand new school, a better school.

1443
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,720
我不想去
I don't want to.

1444
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,040
我想去我的烂学校
I want my crummy school.

1445
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,440
- 你还有弗雷德 - 我不
- And you got Fred. - Please.

1446
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,930
一个月可以回来一次
And once a month you can come back.

1447
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,090
可以跟我和罗伯塔在一起
You can stay with me and Roberta.

1448
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,160
我现在就要你和罗伯塔
I want you and Roberta now!

1449
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,080
几年后 如果你愿意的话
And in a few years, if you want...

1450
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,840
你可以回来 跟我住在一起
you can come back. You can live with me.

1451
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,680
我想留在你那里
I wanna stay with you.

1452
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,330
弗兰克 你跟我保证过的
Frank, you promised me.

1453
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,480
- 别这样 - 你保证过的
- Come on. Don't do this. - You promised me.

1454
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,800
我知道
I know.

1455
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,640
我知道
I know.

1456
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,890
求你了 弗兰克 你为什么要离开我
Please, Frank. Why are you leaving me?

1457
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,010
因为这是法院判的 你是知道的
Because the court said I had to. You know this.

1458
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,000
这事我们谈过多次
We've discussed this ad naus...

1459
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,090
我们谈过的 拜托
We've discussed this. Come on.

1460
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,570
- 拜托 - 不
- Come on, please. - No!

1461
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,760
- 喂 玛丽 - 不
- Hey, Mary. - No!

1462
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,920
喂 玛丽
Hey, Mary.

1463
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,160
不 不
No! No!

1464
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,440
孩子 这样吧
Sweetheart, you know what?

1465
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,680
不
No!

1466
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,290
开始谁都不会愿意
There's no easy way to do this.

1467
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,240
但很快会好起来的 孩子
Not gonna be as long as you think, honey.

1468
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,560
- 弗兰克 - 你会明白的
- Frank! - You're gonna see.

1469
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:21,000
弗兰克
Frank!

1470
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,200
别扔下我
Don't leave me!

1471
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,440
- 我知道你难过 - 求你了
- I know this is hard. - Please!

1472
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,000
不 放开我
No! Get your hands off of me!

1473
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,120
- 弗兰克 求你了 - 我知道你难过
- Frank! Please! - I know it's hard.

1474
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,080
- 回来 - 玛丽 我知道
- Come back! - Mary! I know.

1475
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,440
不
No!

1476
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,320
弗兰克
Frank!

1477
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,400
别走
Don't go!

1478
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,410
我需要你
I need you!

1479
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,880
弗雷德需要你
Fred needs you!

1480
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,440
你保证过的
You promised me!

1481
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,240
不
No!

1482
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,450
嗨
Hey, down there.

1483
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,760
我不知道哪个错误更糟糕
I don't know which mistake is worse.

1484
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,370
设计漏水的水泵
Designing a water pump that leaks...

1485
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,330
还是把水泵放在够不到的地方
or putting it somewhere no human being can reach.

1486
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,880
谁会设计知道会出故障的东西
How do you design something you know is gonna fail?

1487
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,280
肯定是坏人或者笨蛋了
Gotta be devious or clueless, right?

1488
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,320
我把玛丽带来几周之后
After the first few weeks, I knew...

1489
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:02,520
就想给她找个真正的家庭
I had to find a real family for her.

1490
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:08,120
我完全不懂抚养她
I was in way over my head.

1491
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,000
我每天都对自己说
And every day, I'd say, "Today's the day...

1492
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,040
今天说啥也要送她去儿童福利机构
"I'm takin' her to child services."

1493
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,960
而她每一天都会做一件
And every day, she'd do something just...

1494
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,000
那么可爱的事情
so unbelievably cool.

1495
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:30,160
她性格形成的很快
Her little personality was exploding.

1496
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,760
她风趣
She was funny.

1497
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,450
她会生气 会开心 还会
And she was angry, and she was happy, and she was...

1498
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,040
难过
sad.

1499
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,440
还可爱
And was cute.

1500
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,440
让我觉得好玩
Just so damn entertaining.

1501
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,440
我就留下了她
And so I kept her.

1502
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,120
倒不是为了她好
Not that that's in her best interest.

1503
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,920
也不是因为我会抚养孩子
Not that I'm capable of raising a child.

1504
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,680
如果我当时能留心注意到
A child that might still have a mother...

1505
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,200
她妈妈需要我 她也就能有妈妈了
if I had taken the time to notice that she needed me.

1506
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:02,590
到现在 六年半之后
And now, six and a half years later...

1507
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,640
我终于把她送到了寄养家庭
I finally got her to the foster family,

1508
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,050
你知道吗
and you know what?

1509
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,280
那家人很好 她也喜欢
It was great. She loved it.

1510
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,960
我本以为会是场噩梦
I thought it would be a nightmare...

1511
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,610
抛弃和背叛
of abandonment and betrayal.

1512
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,880
但结果却很成功
But, turns out it was a huge success.

1513
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,240
我成了英雄
I'm a fucking hero.

1514
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,200
- 弗兰克 - 不 邦妮
- Frank... - No, Bonnie.

1515
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,800
我感谢你做的一切
I appreciate everything you've done.

1516
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,200
别…
Just...

1517
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,080
- 嗨 - 嗨 弗兰克
- Hey. - Hi, Frank.

1518
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,360
家里出了点问题
We're having a little bit of a problem in there.

1519
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,720
怎么了
What?

1520
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,840
玛丽没事
Uh, Mary's fine...

1521
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,880
但她有点情绪低落
but she's having a little bit of a meltdown.

1522
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,920
是啊 让我劝劝她
Right. Let me talk to her.

1523
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,490
不 等一下
No, hang on.

1524
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,640
这样不好
That's not a good idea.

1525
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,120
你来正是造成她情绪低落的原因
Your visit here is the reason for the meltdown.

1526
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,520
什么
What?

1527
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,880
她不想见你
She don't wanna see you.

1528
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,640
对不起
I'm sorry, man.

1529
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,050
这也不难理解
This is predictable.

1530
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,720
她需要时间
You know, she needs time.

1531
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,810
就让我跟她谈几分钟
Just give me five minutes with her.

1532
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,690
如果让你进去
I let you inside...

1533
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,560
就是背叛了她的信任
then we're gonna betray her trust

1534
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,170
那样问题就更严重了
and we have an even bigger problem.

1535
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,810
哦
Oh...

1536
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,130
- 嗨 - 嗨 我能帮你什么
- Hi. - Hi! Can we help you?

1537
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,760
是的 你们有一只叫弗雷德的橙色独眼猫吗
Yeah. Do you have a one-eyed orange cat named Fred?

1538
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,170
我们有一只独眼猫
We have a one-eyed cat,

1539
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,560
但我不知道它的名字
but I don't know what his name is.

1540
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:16,010
在哪儿
Where?

1541
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,560
不知道 今天是它的最后一天了
I don't know. Today was his last day.

1542
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,650
喂 你不能去后面
Hey, you can't go back there.

1543
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,280
喂
Hey.

1544
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:32,160
喂喂 你到后面干什么
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing back here?

1545
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,520
我说过他不能来
I told him he couldn't.

1546
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,880
嗨 弗雷德
Hey, Fred.

1547
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,680
是谁把猫送来的
Who brought this cat in?

1548
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,200
是个男人 他说他对猫过敏
Some guy. He said it was an allergy issue.

1549
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,960
伊芙琳
Evelyn.

1550
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,400
- 弗兰克 - 伊芙琳在哪儿
- Frank! - Where's Evelyn?

1551
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,920
伊芙琳 你是说你母亲
Evelyn? You mean your mother?

1552
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,650
- 是的 - 凯文
- Yes. - Kevin.

1553
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,170
伊芙琳在客房里
Evelyn is in the guest house.

1554
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,400
听着 我很抱歉
Yeah, listen. I'm sorry, man.

1555
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:47,840
弗兰克 听我说
Frank, let me tell you,

1556
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,880
她请了很好的家教
she was so helpful with the tutors.

1557
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,280
- 玛丽很孤僻 - 喂
- Mary was so distant. - Hey!

1558
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,650
我们知道你的情况
Look, we know what you're up against.

1559
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,690
你想回到从前吗
Do you want your life back?

1560
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,720
不想的话就回去
Go back inside.

1561
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,000
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

1562
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,840
来 玛丽 我们回家
Come on, Mary. We're goin' home.

1563
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,520
- 不 - 你是擅闯私宅
- No. - You're trespassing!

1564
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,800
你需要看看这个
You need to look at this.

1565
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,400
我们走 玛丽
Let's go, Mary.

1566
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,600
- 我们走 - 不
- Let's move. Come on. - No!

1567
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:14,760
- 喂 玛丽 - 玛丽
- Hey! Mary. - Mary!

1568
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,000
玛丽
Mary!

1569
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,480
没事 我去追她
It's okay. I got her.

1570
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,520
有种你试试
Think again, lady.

1571
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,320
玛丽
Mary!

1572
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,640
玛丽 喂 站住
Mary! Hey, stop it.

1573
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,160
不 放开我
No! Let me go!

1574
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,400
不
No!

1575
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,240
- 不 - 住手 玛丽
- No! No! - Stop, Mary!

1576
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:54,840
- 住手 - 不
- Stop. Stop. - No!

1577
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,480
- 过来 - 你骗了我
- Come here. - You lied to me!

1578
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:57,640
我知道
I know!

1579
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,280
- 不 不 - 住手 住手
- No! No! - Stop! Stop, stop!

1580
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,800
对不起
I'm sorry.

1581
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,600
我犯了个错误 我很抱歉
I made a mistake. I'm so sorry.

1582
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,920
你保证过的
You promised me.

1583
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,160
我知道
I know.

1584
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,480
你保证过的
You promised.

1585
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,840
我知道 对不起
I know. I'm sorry.

1586
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,600
你说过不会离开我的
You said you wouldn't leave me.

1587
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,400
我犯了个错误
I made a mistake.

1588
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,640
对不起
I'm sorry.

1589
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,800
我那时好难过
I was so sad!

1590
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,160
我想你
I missed you.

1591
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,960
我也想你
I missed you, too.

1592
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,880
他们把弗雷德送走了
They took Fred.

1593
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,560
不 没事的
No. It's okay.

1594
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,480
- 我找到它了 它就在家里 - 什么
- I got him. He's home. - What?

1595
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,160
它现在就在家里 我找到它了
He's at the apartment right now. I got him.

1596
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,040
真的吗
For real?

1597
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:44,760
是的 它正在踢它的乒乓球呢
Yeah. He's home kicking around his ping pong ball.

1598
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,880
你为什么把我留在这里
Why did you leave me there?

1599
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,680
因为我觉得我抚养不好你
Because I thought I was bad for you.

1600
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,320
但我后来明白
And then it dawned on me.

1601
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,920
既然玛丽成了这么棒
If Mary is this amazing...

1602
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:00,200
聪明 可爱的女孩
smart, sweet human being...

1603
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,440
那说明我肯定做对了什么
then I must be doing something right.

1604
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,160
你笑了
You're smiling.

1605
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,640
罗伯特
Roberta!

1606
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:28,600
孩子
Oh, baby.

1607
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,600
你竟然搞这一出
Of all the stunts you could pull.

1608
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,130
- 她们要去哪儿 - 不去哪儿
- Where are they going? - Nowhere.

1609
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,360
还不到时候
Not yet.

1610
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,770
你们俩出去
You two, out!

1611
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,570
- 这是什么 - 你想知道
- What is this? - Do you want to know...

1612
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:45,690
黛安完成后怎么对我说的吗
how Diane told me she finished?

1613
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,720
这是什么昧着良心的谎言
What is this unconscionable lie?

1614
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,120
我走进她家
I walked into her apartment

1615
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,290
她坐在地板上
and she was sitting on the floor...

1616
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,360
怀里抱着孩子
with that baby in her arms

1617
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,570
你知道她怎么对我说的吗
and you know what she said to me?

1618
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,090
承认吧 这是你编出来的
Admit it. You made this up.

1619
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:55,770
- 她说 我现在该怎么办 - 不
- She said, "What do I do now?" - No.

1620
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,280
这不是完整的证明
It is not a completed proof...

1621
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,090
- 是 - 这不是 不可能
- It is. - No! It isn't! It can't be.

1622
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,480
伊芙琳 别说了
Evelyn, stop!

1623
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,530
我要带走玛丽 抚养她
I'm taking Mary and I'm raising her

1624
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,120
以我认为黛安所希望的方式
how I believe Diane would've wanted.

1625
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,490
- 这由不得你 - 我知道…
- We'll see about that later. - I realize...

1626
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,850
她不是普通人
she's not normal.

1627
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,960
但既然爱因斯坦能骑自行车 那么她也能
But if Einstein can ride a bike, so can she.

1628
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,600
就算是黛安没告诉我 尽管这很荒唐
Let's just say Diane didn't tell me, which is nonsense...

1629
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,000
这毕竟是千年难题
it's a Millennium Problem.

1630
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,920
她肯定会发表出来
She would have shared it with the world.

1631
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,840
这是你露馅的地方
That's where your charade falls apart.

1632
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,960
如果她完成了证明
If she had completed the proof,

1633
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,450
她肯定会发表
she would have published it.

1634
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,760
黛安对我说的很清楚
Diane instructed me very clearly.

1635
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,360
只能在死后发表
That I was only to publish it postmortem.

1636
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,610
她四年前就死了
She died six years ago.

1637
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,480
她说的不是在她死后
It wasn't her death she was talking about.

1638
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:02,160
我试图劝过她
I tried to talk her out of it.

1639
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,130
但你知道黛安的脾气
But you know how Diane could be

1640
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,040
下定决心就没人劝得动
when she made her mind up about something.

1641
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,440
我给麻省理工打过电话
I called MIT.

1642
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,600
尚克兰很期待
Shankland's out of his mind

1643
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,680
能和你一起发表它
about the possibility of publishing it with you.

1644
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,520
他在等你的电话
He's waiting for your call.

1645
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,530
你接下来几年会忙着
You're gonna be spending the next few years of your life...

1646
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,000
维护它
defending it.

1647
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,960
不会有时间照料她
You won't have time for her.

1648
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,960
如果我拒绝呢
What if I say no?

1649
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:39,240
那就继续按她的遗愿
Back to Plan A.

1650
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,600
等我死后再发表
Wait for me to die?

1651
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,320
我知道黛安很倔强
I know Diane was hard.

1652
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,920
我知道她生你的气
I know she was angry.

1653
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,040
但这也带来了好的一面 伊芙琳
But something really good came out of this, Evelyn.

1654
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,560
她现在需要你
She needs you now.

1655
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,520
你是这项工作的不二人选
You're the best woman for the job.

1656
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,530
接受了吧
Take it.

1657
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,320
可是黛安并不想把它给我
It doesn't seem as though Diane wanted me to have it.

1658
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,680
黛安考虑事情不够周全
Diane didn't always think things through.

1659
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,840
我先出去了
I'll be outside.

1660
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,330
你决定之后告诉我一声
Let me know what you wanna do.

1661
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,890
这里是
You've reached

1662
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,360
麻省理工学院数学系
the Department of Mathematics at MIT.

1663
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:01,930
如果你知道对方分机号码
If you know your party's extension,

1664
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,080
请直接拨打
you may dial it at any time.

1665
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,880
如果你想联系接线员
If you wish to speak to an operator...

1666
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,040
请不要挂断
please stay on the line

1667
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,440
会很快有人接听你的电话
and someone will be with you as soon as possible.

1668
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,080
下午好 麻省理工数学系
Good afternoon, MIT Mathematics,

1669
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,320
你要找哪位
how may I direct your call?

1670
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:25,080
喂 抱歉 我听不清你
Hello? I'm sorry. I can't hear you very well.

1671
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:27,080
不
No! No.

1672
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,800
好的 听到你了
Yeah. There you are.

1673
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,240
我能帮你什么吗
Yeah, can I help you?

1674
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,600
是的
Uh, yes.

1675
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,040
尚克兰博士
Doctor Shankland.

1676
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,720
对不起 我听不清
I'm really sorry. I can't hear you.

1677
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,720
你能大点声吗
Could you speak up, please?

1678
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,800
喂
Hello?

1679
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:52,040
我是伊芙琳阿德勒
Evelyn Adler...

1680
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,120
我找西摩尚克兰
for Seymore Shankland, please.

1681
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:57,410
你们要注意的是
And what I want you to notice,

1682
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,880
当通过N计算P时
is that when you compute P of N...

1683
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,960
N等于4模除5
for N congruent to four mod five...

1684
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,850
答案是5的倍数
the answer is a multiple of five.

1685
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,880
最早发现这一点的人
So, the first person to notice this

1686
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,080
是斯里尼瓦瑟拉马努金
was Srinivasa Ramanujan.

1687
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:08,810
在20世纪初
In the beginning of the 20th century...

1688
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,320
他证明了所有全等于
he proved that it was the case for all...

1689
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,360
4模除5的数字都是如此
numbers congruent to four mod five.

1690
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,530
他证明了P等于5的倍数加4
So, he proved that P of five N plus four...

1691
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,840
等于0模除7
is congruent to zero mod seven...

1692
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,600
P等于11的倍数加6
and that P of eleven N plus six
